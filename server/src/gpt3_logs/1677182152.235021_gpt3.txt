DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

In order for a loan to be eligible for a VA guarantee, it must be secured by a first lien on the property. Any existing liens on the property must be paid off or subordinated to the VA loan. If the loan amount, plus any unpaid obligations (such as delinquent taxes, special assessments, or prior mortgage indebtedness), exceeds VA's reasonable value of the property, the loan is not eligible for a VA guarantee.
