QUESTION: What is the DIT requirement?


PASSAGE: officer has no reason to believe that such re-enlistment or  extension of active-duty service will not be granted, or     documentation of other unusual strong positive underwriting factors,  such as a downpayment of at least 10 percent from the borrowers own  assets (not a gift), a minimum of 6 months PITI, in cash, after the  downpayment from the borrowers own assets (not a gift) or clear  evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a non-military  spouses income so high that only minimal income from the active-duty  servicemember is needed to qualify.     If an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES,  the above documentation is not required unless there is evidence that the  Officer has resigned his or her commission.      Example: An Active Duty Veterans LES indicates her ETS date listed on her  LES is 171031 (October 31, 2017) and the projected date of closing is October  1, 2017.  Therefore, one of the above items is needed to verify future income  since her ETS date is less than 12 months from the projected date of closing.    Example: A member of the Reserves has been called to Active Duty.  The  ETS date on his LES indicates 181031 (October 31, 2018); however, his active  duty orders indicate his active duty tour will not exceed the next 60 days.   Therefore, since he will be leaving active duty before 12 months of the  projected closing date, the active-duty income cannot be considered, and his  civilian employment and drill duty will need to be considered.    Example: An Active Duty Veterans LES indicates his ETS date is less than 1  month from the anticipated date of closing, and he indicates he will be  receiving military retirement and has accepted civilian employment.  Verify  his future retirement income from the Department of Defense and verify future  civilian employment with the Veterans new employer.

In most areas, there will be an additional variable housing allowance, which  can also be included. The military quarters and variable housing allowances  are not taxable income.

Ensure that the borrower meets the occupancy requirements set forth in  Chapter 3 of this handbook.
