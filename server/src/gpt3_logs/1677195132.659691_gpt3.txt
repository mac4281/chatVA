RESPONSE:

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) is a federal law that requires lenders to provide data on their home mortgage lending activities. Lenders are required to disclose data on loan applications, loan approvals, and loan denials. The data must be reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and is available to the public. The purpose of this topic in the VA Lender's Handbook is to encourage underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of the credit standards. The examples discussed are certainly not all inclusive, but they should help the underwriter recognize that there are those whose lifestyle, minority status, or location require consideration of extraordinary, yet valid, factors in the underwriting process in order to find a basis for correctly making an approval.
