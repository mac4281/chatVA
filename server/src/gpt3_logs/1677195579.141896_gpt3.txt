QUESTION: What is the 24 month rule?


PASSAGE: this means the date of the credit report or verification  is within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for  new construction).

Verification  ECOA prohibits requests for, or consideration of, credit history and liability  Requirements  information of a spouse who will not be contractually obligated on the loan,  for Debts and  except:  Obligations,    continued    if the borrower(s) is relying on alimony, child support, or maintenance  payments from the spouse (or former spouse), or    in community property states.    If either of these situations is applicable, the lender must:      Obtain a credit report on the non-purchasing spouse in addition to the  Veterans credit report.    Consider the spouses credit history in reaching a determination.  A  Veteran borrower with a satisfactory credit history may be considered a  satisfactory risk even though the non-purchasing spouses credit may  be unsatisfactory.     Include the monthly payment of the non-purchasing spouses debts on  the VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. For debts such as judgments and  unpaid collection accounts, lenders should consider the Veterans  capacity to address the debt(s).     Develop the facts surrounding any unsatisfied judgments on the  spouses credit report, such as where the judgment was filed and  whether the parties were married to one another at the time, and secure  a competent legal opinion whether the judgment may become a lien  against the property.    Exclude the monthly payment on the spouses debts from the loan  analysis when a reliable source of income for the spouse is verified to  reach such a conclusion which is voluntarily provided.    Document VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, with an explanation of  facts and determination when concluding credit worthiness of the  Veteran or excluding obligations of the non-purchasing spouse.

Verification  The payment amount of any alimony and/or child support obligation of the  of Alimony and  borrower must be verified.  Child Support    Obligations  Do not request documentation of a borrowers divorce unless it is necessary to  verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the  borrower.  If, however, in the routine course of processing the loan, the lender  encounters direct evidence (such as, in the credit report) that a child support or  alimony obligation exists, they should make any inquiries necessary to resolve  discrepancies and obtain the appropriate verification.    Spousal support may be treated as a reduction in income on VA Form 26- 6393, Loan Analysis.    Child support payment is treated as a liability on VA Form 26-6393, Loan  Analysis.    c. Analysis of  Significant debts and obligations include:  Debts and    Obligations    debts and obligations with a remaining term of 10 months or more; that  is, long-term obligations, and    accounts with a term of less than 10 months that require payments so  large as to cause a severe impact on the familys resources for any  period of time.    Example: Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a  remaining balance of $1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months,  would be considered significant.  The payment amount is so large as to cause a  severe impact on the familys resources during the first, most critical, months  of the home loan.    Determine whether debts and obligations which do not fit the description of  significant should be given any weight in the analysis.  They may have an  impact on the borrowers ability to provide for family
