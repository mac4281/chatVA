PASSAGE: ETS date on his LES indicates 181031 (October 31, 2018); however, his active  duty orders indicate his active duty tour will not exceed the next 60 days.   Therefore, since he will be leaving active duty before 12 months of the  projected closing date, the active-duty income cannot be considered, and his  civilian employment and drill duty will need to be considered.
