Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question as if you were a company assistant who is reserching answers to questions made by loan officers. You need to also remember the chat history and consider the history in your responses.  The history is an array called "HISTORY".   If you are not 100% sure of the answer, say "I'm not sure, can you rephrase the queston?'":

HISTORY: ['\nHuman: What is the funding fee for the first time use for an IRRRL?', '\nBOT: The funding fee for the first time use for an IRRRL is 0.50%.', '\nHuman: What about subsequent use?', "\nBOT: In order for a loan to be eligible for a VA guarantee, it must be secured by a first lien on the property. Any existing liens on the property must be paid off or subordinated to the VA loan. If the loan amount, plus any unpaid obligations (such as delinquent taxes, special assessments, or prior mortgage indebtedness), exceeds VA's reasonable value of the property, the loan is not eligible for a VA guarantee.", '\nHuman: What is the % for subsequent use?']

Refunding  A refund is appropriate if:  Overpayments    to the Veteran   an exempt veteran paid a funding fee, or   a miscalculation of the fee caused an overpayment.    Using the VA FFPS, lenders can make appropriate corrections that may result  in refunds being due.      If the veteran was overcharged, the following applies:     A veteran who paid cash for the funding fee receives a cash refund for the  amount of the overpayment.   In the case of a veteran who paid the funding fee out of loan proceeds, the  lender must apply the overpayment against the loan balance.  Submit  evidence to VA that the refund was applied to the loans principal balance.         8-22   NEW PAGE  Chapter 9 Legal Instruments, Liens, Escrows, and                       Related Issues  Overview      In this Chapter  This chapter contains the following topics.
