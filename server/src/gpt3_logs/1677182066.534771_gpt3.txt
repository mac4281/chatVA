If Veterans cannot locate proof of service, they can request military documents  either through the National Archives, http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/, or by  completing SF- 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records. The completed  form should be submitted to the appropriate address shown. It should not be  sent to VA.
