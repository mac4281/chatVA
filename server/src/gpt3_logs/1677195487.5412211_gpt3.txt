QUESTION: What if they were never activated?  could they still be eligible?


PASSAGE: Members,  The statement must clearly indicate that the applicant is an active reservist or  Continued  National Guard member and not just in a control group (inactive status).    If Veterans cannot locate proof of service, they can request military documents  either through the National Archives, http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/, or by  completing SF- 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records. The completed  form should be submitted to the appropriate address shown. It should not be  sent to VA.    In many cases, VA internal systems will have sufficient information to make  the eligibility determination for those who served on active duty.  Lenders and  Veterans should not delay requesting a COE pending receipt of requested  military documents.        2-14    NEW PAGE  VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised   Chapter 2:  Veterans Eligibility and Entitlement   5.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The applicant must have served on active duty for at least 90 days, any part of which must have occurred during wartime. This does not necessarily mean that the applicant needs to have been deployed, but they must have served on active duty during wartime. If the applicant was never activated, they may still be eligible if they served on active duty for at least 90 days during wartime.
