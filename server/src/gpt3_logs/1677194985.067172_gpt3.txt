Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question as if you were a company assistant who is reserching answers to questions made by loan officers. You need to also remember the chat history and use the chat history to discern the context of the query.  The history is an array called "HISTORY".   If you are not 100% sure of the answer, say "I'm not sure, can you rephrase the queston?'":

HISTORY: ['\nHuman: What about loan assumptions?', '\nBOT: Loan assumptions are when the responsibility of a loan is transferred from the original borrower to a new borrower. The new borrower must go through a credit check and be approved by the lender in order to assume the loan. The process of assuming a loan is different depending on the date of the loan commitment. For loans committed on or after March 1, 1988, the lender must determine the creditworthiness of the new borrower. For loans committed before March 1, 1988, the Veterans Administration (VA) must determine the creditworthiness of the new borrower.', '\nHuman: What is the funding fee for a loan assumption?', '\nBOT: The funding fee for a loan assumption is one-half of one percent of the loan.', '\nHuman: can you read back the chat history?']

QUESTION: can you read back the chat history?
