HISTORY: ['\nHuman: what does it say about appraisal fees?', '\nBOT: The passage says that if a veteran wants to change lenders after an appraisal has been ordered, the requester must certify in WebLGY that the appraisal fee has been paid and is being held to be paid to the appraiser. The requester has 30 to 45 days to pay the fee. If the requester does not pay the fee, the RLC may require advance payment from the requester on future appraisals.', '\nHuman: Can you explain the funding fee to me?', '\nBOT: The funding fee is a fee charged by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help cover the cost of the VA home loan program. The fee is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount, and can vary depending on the type of loan, the type of service member, and other factors. The funding fee for a VA home loan is 2.15% of the loan amount for most borrowers.VA loans made by first-time homebuyers with no down payment are exempt from the funding fee. Veterans who are considered 50% or more disabled are also exempt from the funding fee. For all other VA loans, the funding fee is typically rolled into the loan so that borrowers dont have to pay it upfront. Borrowers who make a down payment of at least 5% may choose to finance the funding fee or pay it in cash, but borrowers who make a down payment of less than 5% must finance the funding fee.', '\nHuman: What does the passage say about who is exempt from the funding fee?']

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The passage says that veterans receiving VA compensation for service-connected disabilities, veterans who would be entitled to receive compensation for service-connected disabilities if they did not receive retirement pay, veterans who are rated by VA as eligible to receive compensation as a result of pre-discharge disability examination and rating or on the basis of a pre-discharge review of existing medical evidence (including service medical and treatment records) that results in issuance of a memorandum rating, and veterans entitled to receive compensation, but who are not presently in receipt because they are on active duty are exempt from paying the funding fee. The surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service- connected disabilities (whether or not such surviving spouses are veterans with their own entitlement and whether or not they are using their own entitlement on the loan) are also exempt.
