PASSAGE: Pamphlet 26-7, Revised   Chapter 2:  Veterans Eligibility and Entitlement   3. How to Apply For A Certificate of Eligibility   Change Date  March 28, 2019   This chapter has been revised in its entirety.    a. Procedures  Lenders must first attempt to obtain a COE through the ACE application,  which can be accessed through the VIP.      If a COE cannot be obtained immediately, lenders should select the electronic  application link that permits them to submit an electronic application.If the  COE is issued with reduced entitlement and restoration is needed, use the  Correct COE function to request an updated COE.      The WebLGY system allows lenders to upload documentation, such as  discharge papers or evidence to support restoration (Closing Disclosure,  HUD-1 etc.), along with the electronic application. Lenders should not  upload scanned documents without first completing an electronic application.  Using this feature, rather than mail, is the preferred method, as it greatly  reduces processing time.      Inability to obtain a COE in WebLGY does not mean the Veteran is  ineligible, only that the system does not have sufficient information to  make an automatic determination.  Lenders should always continue the  application process as described in the preceding paragraph.    Application for an Unmarried Surviving Spouses. A surviving spouse  of a Veteran, who dies on active duty or from service-connected  causes, may still be eligible for a COE.  If the surviving spouse is  remarried on or after age 57, and on or after December 16, 2003, they  still may be eligible.  Eligibility may also be granted to the spouse of  an active duty member who is listed as MIA or POW for at least 90  days.  Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited to one-time  use only.

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) is a federal law that requires lenders to provide data on their home mortgage lending activities. Lenders are required to disclose data on loan applications, loan approvals, and loan denials. The data must be reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and is available to the public. The purpose of this topic in the VA Lender's Handbook is to encourage underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of the credit standards. The examples discussed are certainly not all inclusive, but they should help the underwriter recognize that there are those whose lifestyle, minority status, or location require consideration of extraordinary, yet valid, factors in the underwriting process in order to find a basis for correctly making an approval.
