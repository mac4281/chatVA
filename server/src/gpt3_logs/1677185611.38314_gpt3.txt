PASSAGE: transfer, the servicer may decide to demand  immediate payment of the one-half of one percent VA funding fee and  request a copy of the instrument of transfer to determine the liability of the  purchaser.    Loans for which a commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988, are  commonly known as freely assumable loans.  Owners have the right to sell  the property securing these loans under any terms; servicers may not impose  a restriction, charge, or fee that would limit or nullify this right.  A funding  fee is not assessed on assumptions of loans where the commitment was made  prior to March 1, 1988.

Liability not assumed.  If prior approval of a transfer was not  obtained and the title was transferred subject to the mortgage or  deed of trust, then the purchaser usually has no liability on the loan  and no liability for the funding fee.

An exception applies when the loan was made by a state, territorial,  or local governmental agency and the law requires acceleration of the  maturity of the loan upon sale or transfer of the property to a person  not eligible for assistance under the special program.
