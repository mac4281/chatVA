PASSAGE: apply the appropriate percentage (from the  Calculate the  funding fee tables) to the loan amount.    Funding Fee    If the funding fee is to be paid from loan proceeds, apply the percentage to the  loan amount without the funding fee amount added to it.      For IRRRLs, calculate the funding fee by completing VA Form 26-8923,  IRRRL Worksheet.    Reference:  For joint loans, see Calculation of the Funding Fee in section 1  of chapter 7.

Examine the COE.  For  Reserves/National Guard, the COE bears the notation,  RESERVES/NATIONAL GUARD - INCREASED FUNDING FEE, and  is buff-colored rather than green.   Is the veteran a subsequent user of VA home loan benefits or obtaining his  or her first VA loan?  Examine the COE.  An entitlement code of 5  indicates subsequent use, as does a loan number entered in the Loan  Number column.    What type of loan is the veteran obtaining?  The funding fee varies  depending upon whether the loan is a purchase or construction loan, an  IRRRL, or a cash-out refinancing loan.   Is the veteran making a downpayment of at least five or ten percent?   Calculate what percentage of the sales price of the property the veteran is  remitting as a downpayment.   The downpayment may come from the veterans own resources or  borrowed funds.  Except, if the purchase price exceeds the reasonable  value of the property, the difference between the purchase price and the  reasonable value must be paid by the veteran in cash without borrowing.   For construction loans only, equity in the secured property counts as a  downpayment for calculating the funding fee.
