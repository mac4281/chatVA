Automated Underwriting    Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4   This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.   Subsection a has been changed to add a reference to the Zippy program.   Subsection cs reference to Fannie Mae and Freddie Macs automated  underwriting systems has been changed to provider of these systems.   This change is due to the increase in the number of approved systems.    a. General  VA has approved the use of several automated underwriting systems.  The  systems are     Freddie Macs Loan Prospector,   Fannie Maes DU,   Countrywides CLUES System, and   Chases Zippy    Note:  The Chase and Countrywide systems may only be used in connection  with their loans.     The systems are only for use by VA automatic lenders, and only on loans  eligible for automatic processing.      These systems assign a risk classification which determines the level of  underwriting and documentation needed.    b. Lender  The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely  Responsibility  determine a risk classification.  It is still the lenders decision whether or not  to approve the loan.      Lenders are still responsible for meeting all VA requirements for all loans;  however they may take advantage of certain documentation waivers based on  the risk classification.    c. VAs Role  Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor.  The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider  of these systems.

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)    Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4  This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.     a.  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data,  Compatibility  many lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate  of VA Program  measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to  with HMDA  home mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be  aware of how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in  meeting this goal.    The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for  individuals with low-to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not  overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans  for such applicants.  The VA Credit Standards are written as guidelines and  are meant to be interpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration  all of an individual loan applicants financial, employment and family  circumstances.      This topic provides guidance on areas of underwriting that may be of  particular concern when processing applications for low-to-moderate income  borrowers.  Many of the concepts are discussed in Chapter 4, Credit  Underwriting, but are repeated here to emphasize their importance and  applicability to underwriting loans to minority and low-to-moderate income  applicants.    b. Purpose  This topic in the VA Lender's Handbook is intended to encourage  underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be  approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of the credit  standards.  The examples discussed are certainly not all inclusive, but they  should help the underwriter recognize that there are those whose lifestyle,  minority status, or location require consideration of extraordinary, yet valid,  factors in the underwriting process in order to find a basis for correctly  making an approval
