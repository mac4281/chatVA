RESPONSE:

The funding fee is a fee charged by the VA to help defray the costs of administering the VA Home Loan program. The fee is paid by the veteran at loan closing. The amount of the fee may be financed, and varies depending on the type of loan, the amount of the down payment, and whether the borrower has used the VA Home Loan benefit before. For more information on the funding fee, please see Chapter 8 of the VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised.
