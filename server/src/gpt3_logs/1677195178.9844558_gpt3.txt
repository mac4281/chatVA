There are a few steps that need to be followed when originating a VA loan. The first step is to ensure that the occupancy requirements are met. The next step is to complete the procedures and verifications described in Chapter 4 of the VA Lender's Handbook. Once all of the information has been gathered, the underwriter will need to review and approve the loan. The next step is to obtain a Certificate of Commitment from the Regional Loan Center. The last step is to upload the closing package into WebLGY for the RLC's final review.
