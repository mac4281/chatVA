Example: Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a  remaining balance of $1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months,  would be considered significant.  The payment amount is so large as to cause a  severe impact on the familys resources during the first, most critical, months  of the home loan.    Determine whether debts and obligations which do not fit the description of  significant should be given any weight in the analysis.  They may have an  impact on the borrowers ability to provide for family


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The 24 month rule refers to the date of the credit report or verification. The credit report or verification must be within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for new construction). This means that the lender must obtain a credit report on the non-purchasing spouse in addition to the Veterans credit report. The lender must also consider the spouses credit history in reaching a determination. A Veteran borrower with a satisfactory credit history may be considered a satisfactory risk even though the non-purchasing spouses credit may be unsatisfactory.
