RESPONSE:

The passage says that the funding fee is a fee charged by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help cover the cost of the VA home loan program. The fee is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount, and can vary depending on the type of loan, the type of service member, and other factors. The funding fee for a VA home loan is 2.15% of the loan amount for most borrowers. Exceptions to the funding fee are first-time homebuyers with no down payment, and veterans who are considered 50% or more disabled. For all other VA loans, the funding fee is typically rolled into the loan so that borrowers don't have to pay it upfront. Borrowers who make a down payment of at least 5% may choose to finance the funding fee or pay it in cash, but borrowers who make a down payment of less than 5% must finance the funding fee.
