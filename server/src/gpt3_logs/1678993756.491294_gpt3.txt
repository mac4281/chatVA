PROMPT:

Answer the question as you were a mortgage professional using the response for the semantic search:If called to active duty, a copy of the orders must accompany the SOS with the name and point of contact for the command or unit.

The statement must clearly indicate that the applicant is an active reservist or National Guard member and not just in a control group (inactive status).

If Veterans cannot locate proof of service, they can request military documents either through the National Archives, http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/, or by completing SF- 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records. The completed form should be submitted to the appropriate address shown. It should not be sent to VA.

In many cases, VA internal systems will have sufficient information to make the eligibility determination for those who served on active duty. Lenders and Veterans should not delay requesting a COE pending receipt of requested military documents.
