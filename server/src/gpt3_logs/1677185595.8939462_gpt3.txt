General  If you are not the loan servicer or holder of the current VA loan, please refer  Information the borrower or purchaser to the servicer or holder of the current VA loan for  processing.  Assumptions can only be processed and closed by loan holders  and services with VA automatic authority that are holding or servicing the  current VA loan.      Loan holders or servicers holding the loan without VA automatic authority  that are holding or servicing the current VA loan, may submit a prior approval  package to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located. See  Topic 1 of this chapter.     A VA assumption is also considered a Release of Liability (ROL).     Properties that are security for VA-guaranteed loans may be disposed or  transferred even though the loans are not paid in full. Veterans who dispose or  transfer their properties under these conditions remain liable to VA for any  loss that may occur as a result of a future default and subsequent claim  payment, unless the property is transferred to a creditworthy purchaser who  agrees to assume the payment obligation.  The servicer initially determines the  purchasers creditworthiness.

RESPONSE:

Loan assumptions are when the responsibility of a loan is transferred from the original borrower to a new borrower. The new borrower must go through a credit check and be approved by the lender in order to assume the loan. The process of assuming a loan is different depending on the date of the loan commitment. For loans committed on or after March 1, 1988, the lender must determine the creditworthiness of the new borrower. For loans committed before March 1, 1988, the Veterans Administration (VA) must determine the creditworthiness of the new borrower.
