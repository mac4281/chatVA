QUESTION: How much is the funding fee for first time use according to the passage?


PASSAGE: funding fee will be assessed on any portion of a joint loan allocable to a:     Non-Veteran   Veteran who did not use his or her entitlement, or   Veteran who used his or her entitlement, but is exempt from the funding  fee.    Downpayment.  The actual loan amount is allocated equally between the  borrowers for purposes of calculating the funding fee, whether or not a  downpayment is made, and regardless of where the funds for such a  downpayment come from.     Example.  On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the non-Veteran makes a $5,000  (five percent) downpayment out of his cash resources, to purchase a $100,000  property, resulting in a $95,000 loan amount. The Veteran is a first-time  homebuyer.  The Veteran must pay a funding fee of $712.50, based on 1.5  percent of his/her $47,500 portion.

Construction/Permanent Home Loans    Change Date   March 11, 2019     This chapter has been revised in its entirety    a. The Basics  VA will guarantee a construction/permanent home loan, that is, a loan to  finance the construction/purchase of a residence.  The loan is closed prior to  the start of construction with proceeds disbursed to cover the cost of, or  balance owed on, the land, and the balance into escrow.  The escrowed  monies are paid out to the builder during construction.    The lender must obtain written approval from the borrower before each draw  payment is provided to the builder.  The loan will not be guaranteed until  construction is complete and all Notice of Value (NOV) conditions are met.    This section does not address other construction loans guaranteed by VA; that  is, those for the purchase of a residence newly constructed for the Veteran by  a builder who financed the construction from his or her own resources.    Lenders should have the specialized experience to originate, process,  underwrite (borrower, project, and builder), close, service and administer such  loans.  These types of loans and projects inherently have uncertain elements  that require careful examination.

The Veteran begins making payments on a construction/permanent home loan  Amortization  only after construction is complete.  Therefore, the initial payment on the  principal may be postponed up to 1 year, if necessary.  The loan must be  amortized to achieve full repayment within its remaining term.  The lender  must provide evidence of the amortization in the loan file.    Example.  If it takes 6 months to complete construction, the payment schedule  for the Veteran obtaining a 30-year mortgage must provide for full repayment  of the loan in 29 years and 6 months.
