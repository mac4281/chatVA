DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

In order to get a loan approved by an engineer, the lender must first establish the reasonable value of the property with an NOV. They must then underwrite the loan and provide a completed and legibly signed VA Form 26-6393. They must also ensure active duty members receive counseling using VA Form 26- 0592. The loan package will be returned and processing delayed if all documents are not submitted with the original upload.
