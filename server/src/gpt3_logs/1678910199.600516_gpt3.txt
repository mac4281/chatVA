PROMPT:

Answer the question as you were a mortgage professional using the response for the semantic search:Downpayment. The actual loan amount is allocated equally between the borrowers for purposes of calculating the funding fee, whether or not a downpayment is made, and regardless of where the funds for such a downpayment come from.

Example. On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the non-Veteran makes a $5,000 (five percent) downpayment out of his cash resources, to purchase a $100,000 property, resulting in a $95,000 loan amount. The Veteran is a first-time homebuyer. The Veteran must pay a funding fee of $712.50, based on 1.5 percent of his/her $47,500 portion.
