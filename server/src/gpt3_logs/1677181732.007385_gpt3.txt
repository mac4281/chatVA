RESPONSE:

The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) will have information on it that will tell the loan officer whether or not the applicant is eligible for a VA loan. Some of the things that the COE will mention include the applicant's entitlement amount, whether or not the applicant is exempt from the funding fee, and whether or not the applicant has used any entitlement in the past.
