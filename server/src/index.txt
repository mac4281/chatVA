2.  Misleading Advertisements 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 
a. Policy  The Department of Veterans Affairs always strives to provide all veterans the 
most up-to-date and pertinent information about their benefits.  Toward that 
end, all appropriate efforts by lenders to further educate or remind veterans 
about their home loan benefit and the lender’s availability to assist the veteran 
in obtaining the benefit is appreciated.  However, it is inappropriate to direct 
any information about benefits to veterans which is in any way misleading. 
 
It must be clearly understood that VA has a very specific mission to serve 
veterans, who are declared by Congress to be a “special class of citizen,” and 
veterans rely on VA to provide dependable service and reliable information 
concerning their benefits.   
 
Any action on the part of lenders or other program participants which 
jeopardizes VA’s credibility with veterans or induces veterans to obtain loans 
which are clearly not in their best interests would be viewed by VA as actions 
which are detrimental to the best interests of veterans.  If such a determination 
is made, grounds for suspension from participation in the VA Loan Guaranty 
Program could be established. 
 
b. Examples  Example 1: 
 
In increasing numbers, VA has been receiving inquiries and complaints from 
veterans concerning advertisements and solicitations they have received from 
lenders which state that VA has a new program to refinance their VA loan 
and lower their interest rate, an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan 
(IRRRL).   
 
The IRRRL program has been available to veterans since the enactment of 
The Veterans’ Disability Compensation and Housing Benefits Amendments 
of 1980 (Public Law 96-385).   
 
In addition, many of these solicitations suggest that the lender has some 
special relationship with VA that enables only them to offer this loan 
opportunity.  Some even clearly attempts to give the impression that the 
“letter” the veteran received came from VA.

2.  Misleading Advertisements, 
Continued 
  
b. Examples  Example 2: 
(continued)  Another unacceptable advertising approach that some lenders have been using 
is to invite veterans to “skip” payments and refinance their loan.  It generally 
gives the appearance that VA condones skipping payments and rolling them 
into the new IRRRL. This is not the case. 
   
It is irresponsible to suggest to any mortgagor that this program encourages 
skipping payments, or that this is an appropriate means of getting around the 
prohibition against receiving cash from the transaction.   
 
Any advertising that promotes skipping payments as a means of obtaining 
cash for other purposes is unacceptable. 
 
c. Lender  VA encourages all lenders to continue offering VA financing to all eligible 
Responsibility  and qualified veterans, and it is recognized that mortgage lending is a 
competitive industry.  However, VA insists that lenders refrain from any and 
all practices which might mislead veterans into actions which are contrary to 
their own best interests.   
 
If your firm has been engaging in such advertising, or is considering doing so, 
VA strongly recommends that anything in your promotional material which is 
in any way inaccurate or misleading be deleted.  If there is uncertainty about 
the accuracy or propriety of the advertisement or solicitation, please consult 
with the appropriate local VA office or the Loan Policy staff at VA Central 
Office at (202) 273-7368. 
 
d. Sanctions  Sanctions of program participants for violations of regulations are set forth in 
38 CFR part 44.   Refer to Chapter 17 for additional information on sanctions 
of program participants.

 Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, 
 Fannie Mae’s DU, 
 Countrywide’s CLUES System, and 
 Chase’s Zippy 
 
Note:  The Chase and Countrywide systems may only be used in connection 
with their loans.  
 
The systems are only for use by VA automatic lenders, and only on loans 
eligible for automatic processing.   
 
These systems assign a risk classification which determines the level of 
underwriting and documentation needed. 
 
b. Lender  The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely 
Responsibility  determine a risk classification.  It is still the lender’s decision whether or not 
to approve the loan.   
 
Lenders are still responsible for meeting all VA requirements for all loans; 
however they may take advantage of certain documentation waivers based on 
the risk classification. 
 
c. VA’s Role  Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor. 
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these systems.

4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 
a.  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, 
Compatibility  many lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate 
of VA Program  measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to 
with HMDA 
home mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be 
aware of how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in 
meeting this goal. 
 
The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for 
individuals with low-to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such applicants.  The “VA Credit Standards” are written as guidelines and 
are meant to be interpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration 
all of an individual loan applicant’s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.   
 
This topic provides guidance on areas of underwriting that may be of 
particular concern when processing applications for low-to-moderate income 
borrowers.  Many of the concepts are discussed in Chapter 4, Credit 
Underwriting, but are repeated here to emphasize their importance and 
applicability to underwriting loans to minority and low-to-moderate income 
applicants. 
 
b. Purpose  This topic in the “VA Lender's Handbook” is intended to encourage 
underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be 
approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of the credit 
standards.  The examples discussed are certainly not all inclusive, but they 
should help the underwriter recognize that there are those whose lifestyle, 
minority status, or location require consideration of extraordinary, yet valid, 
factors in the underwriting process in order to find a basis for correctly 
making an approval decision. 
 
Underwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications 
for every qualified veteran.

c. Use of VA  Although lenders that have automatic authority should use that authority to 
Prior Approval  the maximum extent possible, another important tool available to lenders 
Procedure  seeking to increase credit access by minority and lower income borrowers is 
the optional use of VA’s prior-approval processing.   
 
Loan applications that may not be clearly approvable under VA’s published 
credit standards but which, in the lender’s view, contain compensating 
strengths, may be sent to VA on the prior-approval basis.  Lenders should 
submit an explanation as to why the loan was not closed automatically and 
point out the reasons why they believe the loan may be approvable. 
 
d. Employment  A borrower’s employment and income stability are vital to the underwriting 
and Income  of a loan.  There are characteristics that should be considered when 
Stability  underwriting loans for low-to-moderate income borrowers when evaluating 
acceptable employment and income. 
 
Changing of Jobs 
It is possible to establish stable and reliable income without having 
established a stable employment history in one position or job.  It is not 
unusual for some borrowers to change jobs frequently, even changing lines of 
work.  The borrower may be simply going where there is available work.  To 
establish stability and continuance of income, the borrower must demonstrate 
the ability to maintain an income at a constant level over the recent 2-year 
period even if he or she has worked for a variety of employers. 
 
Part-Time Employment 
It is not uncommon for people with limited income from their primary 
employment to take on part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  Ideally 
the borrower should show a two-year history, but one year may be considered 
for an otherwise strong borrower.  Underwriters must review such income for 
probable continuance and try to assure that the part-time employment is 
reasonable and sustainable.

d. Employment  Periods of Unemployment 
and Income  In parts of the country, it is not unusual for some individuals to work for 
Stability  certain times of the year and draw unemployment for the remainder of the 
(continued) 
year (such as field workers).  A period or periods of unemployment will not 
automatically be considered unfavorably, provided the unemployment is 
regular and seasonal, or is a limited occurrence between jobs, and 
unemployment compensation has been received during those periods.  If the 
applicant has a history of such an income pattern, unemployment 
compensation as well as income received during periods of employment may 
be used when calculating an individual’s income for loan approval purposes. 
  
e. Source of  Another area where low-to-moderate income borrowers sometimes differ 
Funds to Close  from others is the source of funds to close loans.  It is not unusual or 
unacceptable for some borrowers to save money at home versus using 
depositories.  In order to be acceptable, a reasonable explanation of how the 
borrower saved the funds should be provided. 
 
f. Credit  In the area of credit, the lack of an established credit history should not be a 
History  deterrent to loan approval.  As provided in the credit standards, a satisfactory 
payment history on items such as rent, utilities, phone bills, etc., may be used 
to establish a satisfactory credit history.

g. Consider All  As stated in the credit standards, no single factor is a determinant in any 
Factors  applicant’s qualification for a VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
 A veteran who has maintained an excellent credit history, (such as 
satisfactory payment of a shelter expense comparable to the proposed 
shelter expense) may be approvable in spite of shortfall in the residual 
income.  In such an instance, it might be appropriate to consider that the 
veteran has established a lifestyle which is substantially different from the 
average used in establishing the residual income tables in the credit 
standards. 
 A veteran with a good credit record who meets the residual income 
guideline (without exceeding it by 20 percent) may be approvable in spite 
of a high debt-to-income ratio if the proposed shelter expense is not 
significantly greater than the amount the veteran has been accustomed to 
paying. 
 
h.  The use of compensating factors is encouraged for marginally approvable VA 
Compensating  loans, and a detailed explanation of their use in underwriting loans is 
Factors  provided in the credit standards.   
 
A compensating factor that has come into play quite recently is the numerous 
financial and homeownership counseling programs being provided by a 
variety of sources including banks, mortgage lenders, and community groups.  
These counseling programs are designed to help applicants work out payment 
plans for old debts, design savings plans, and teach basic budgeting skills.  
Programs often include homebuyer education lessons and post-closing 
counseling to assist the new homeowners once the loan is made.  Participation 
by an applicant in such a counseling program can be viewed as a strong 
compensating factor for a case in which it is otherwise difficult to conclude 
that a borrower is qualified under a traditional interpretation of the credit 
standards.

Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
 This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 Subsection a has been created by combining the two previous subsections 
into one.  This new subsection encourages lenders to use their automatic 
authority in every possible instance before submitting a loan to VA for 
underwriting.

Automatic 
 
Lenders 
Except for cases specifically precluded from automatic processing, such as 
joint loans, the only cases lenders should consider submitting to VA for prior 
approval are those in which the underwriter firmly believes approval can be 
justified.  However, the specific facts of the case appear to preclude approval.  
In such instances, the underwriter must include: 
 
 a detailed explanation of why the loan should be approved by VA, plus 
 a thorough justification for not approving the loan on the automatic basis.   
 
It will not be sufficient to justify submitting the loan to VA solely to comply 
with the veteran’s or the real estate agent’s request to do so.

loans that must be submitted to VA for prior approval by all lenders. 
 
These loan types are listed in Topic 1 of this chapter under “Prior Approval.” 
 
The supervised lender must obtain VA recognition of agents it uses to make 
VA loans. See Topic 7 of this chapter for more information. 
 
If the lender uses an agent, it must submit the following to the VA office with 
jurisdiction over its home office by January 31 of each year: 
 
 a list of the VA-recognized agency relationships it wishes to renew, 
 the annual renewal fee (see Topic 10 of this chapter) for each lender agent

Although VA offices may issue an annual reminder notice to lenders that the 
above information is due, lenders bear the ultimate responsibility for timely 
submission of the information and appropriate fees.  Failure to pay annual

The extent of the relationship between the lender and the agent is at the 
lender’s discretion and the following lender responsibilities must be met: 
 
 The lender must accept full responsibility for the acts, errors, or omissions 
of the agent in processing and/or closing loans. 
 The lender accepts this responsibility by certification on VA Form 26-1820, 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement, and the corporate 
resolution. 
 The lender may not subsequently claim that it should not be held 
accountable for inaccurate or fraudulent credit information or other loan 
data because it relied on the agent. 
 Irregularities resulting from acts or omissions of the agent are treated as acts 
or omissions of the lender. 
 The lender’s use of an agent will not prevent VA from taking actions in 
appropriate cases such as denial of liability, claim adjustments, collection of 
the amount of any loss incurred due to irregularities, and imposition of 
sanctions against both the lender and the agent. 
 
If the lender is a non-supervised automatic lender, loans made by an agent on 
its behalf which are closed automatically must be reviewed and approved by a 
VA-approved underwriter employed by the lender.

8.  Mergers and Acquisitions Involving Supervised or Non-
supervised Automatic Lenders 
  
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. The Issue  Changes in ownership or corporate structure of a lender may impact its 
continued qualifications for automatic authority.  Lenders must notify VA 
whenever a merger, acquisition, or change in the ownership of the lender 
occurs, so that VA can evaluate any impact on the lender’s participation in the 
VA Home Loan program.  
 
Although only the terms “merger” and “acquisition” and “selling,” 
“acquiring” or “surviving” entities are used in this paragraph, the concepts 
and procedures in this paragraph apply to every type of restructuring that has 
a significant impact on an organization’s ownership, structure, or assets, and 
so on.

 a general description of the assets being acquired in the merger or

 the addresses of all branch offices and their current VA ID numbers that are 
involved in VA mortgage lending, and whether they will continue to 
operate or be closed.  
 a list of agents and their VA ID numbers that will be used by the surviving

Topic 7 of this chapter for more information. 
 
Note:  Any of these items that remain unchanged do not have to be 
resubmitted; simply indicate that they are unchanged. 
Questions about merger or acquisition transactions should be sent to the RLC 
of jurisdiction.  Since each merger or acquisition is unique, VA may discover 
that it needs to request additional information from the lender during its 
review.  Lenders with questions may send an e-mail to

9.  Withdrawal of Automatic Authority from Supervised or 
Non-supervised Automatic Lenders 
   
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. General  VA can withdraw a lender’s automatic authority for proper cause, after giving 
the lender 30 days notice. This applies to both supervised and non-supervised 
lenders.  VA regulations at 38 CFR 36.4349 provide the framework.  The 
lender may continue processing loans on a prior approval basis after its 
automatic authority has been withdrawn. 
 
The remainder of this Topic gives the reasons a lender’s automatic authority 
can be withdrawn, and the corresponding period for which the withdrawal 
will be effective. 
  
b. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for an indefinite period can be based on any of the following: 
for an   
Indefinite  Failure to continue meeting basic qualifying criteria: 
Period 
 
  For supervised lenders, this includes loss of status as an entity subject 
to examination and supervision by a Federal or State regulatory 
agency. 
  For non-supervised lenders, this includes no approved underwriter, 
failure to maintain $50,000 working capital or $250,000 adjusted net 
worth, and/or failure to file the required financial statements. 
 
Any of the causes for debarment set forth in 38 CFR 44. 
 
During the probationary period for newly-approved non-supervised automatic 
lenders, automatic authority may be withdrawn for poor underwriting 
consistently careless processing, failure to provide loan files timely, or to 
provide other necessary documents as requested by VA.

c. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for 60 days can be based on any of the following: 
for 60 Days   
 Loan submissions show deficiencies in credit underwriting after repeatedly 
being called to the lender’s attention, such as the use of unstable sources of 
income to qualify borrower or ignoring significant adverse credit items 
affecting applicant’s creditworthiness.   
 
 Employment or deposit verifications are hand carried by applicants or 
otherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands of a third party. 
 
 Consistently incomplete loan submissions after repeatedly being called to 
the lender’s attention. 
  
 Continued instances of disregard of VA requirements after repeatedly being 
called to the lender’s attention.

d. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for 180 days can be based on any of the following: 
for 180 Days   
 Loans conflict with VA credit standards and would not have been made by a 
lender acting prudently. 
 Failure to disclose to VA significant obligations or other information so 
material to the Veteran’s ability to repay the loan that undue risk to the 
Government results. 
 Employment or deposit verifications are hand carried by the applicant or 
otherwise mishandled, resulting in submission of significant misinformation 
to VA. 
 Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA 
requirements to Veterans to the detriment of their interests. 
 
Examples: 
  The Veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest rate based on 
lender’s incorrect advice that such options were excluded by VA  
requirements. 
 Closing documents show instances of improper charges to Veteran after 
the impropriety of such charges are called to lender’s attention by VA, or 
the lender refuses to refund such charges after notification by VA. 
 Other instances of lender actions prejudicial to the interests of Veterans 
such as deliberate delays in scheduling loan closings. 
 
 
e. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for 1 to 3 years can be based on any of the following:   
for 1 to 3   
Years   Failure to properly disburse loans, such as loan disbursement checks are 
returned due to insufficient funds. 
 
 Involvement by the lender in the improper use of a Veteran’s entitlement, 
such as knowingly permitting the Veteran to violate occupancy 
requirements. 
 
 Lender involvement in the Veteran’s sale of entitlement to a third party, 
such as a lender makes the loan with the knowledge that the Veteran is not 
purchasing the property to be his or her home.  Instead, the Veteran intends 
to transfer title to a third party who assumes the loan shortly after closing.

processing fee, VA will delay processing of the request until the fee is 
received.  
 
Fees are nonrefundable, even if the request is denied (except in cases of 
accidental overpayment).  
 
Pay all fees by lender’s check to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
 
If an agent, underwriter, or SAR approved by VA for a role with one lender 
begins work for another lender, the new lender must request and pay the fee 
for a new VA recognition or approval of that individual. 
  
b. Annual Fees  Remit fees within 120 days of the end of the lender’s fiscal year to the RLC

13.  Calculation of Adjusted Net Worth 
  
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. Method  Net worth for VA purposes is determined by 38 C.F.R. §36.4352(b)(4)(ii). 
   
b. CPA  Adjusted net worth must be calculated by a CPA using an audited and 
Requirement  certified balance sheet from the lender’s latest financial statement, per the 
above regulation. 
  
c. Calculation  Adjusted net worth is total assets, minus total liabilities, minus the following 
unacceptable assets: 
 Any assets of the lender pledged to secure obligations of another person or 
entity. 
 Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender or related 
entities, in which the lender’s officers or stockholders have a personal 
interest, unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder.  Personal 
interest indicates a relationship between the lender and a person or entity in 
which that specified person has a financial interest in or is employed in a 
management position by the lender. 
 Any investment in related entities in which the lender’s officers or 
stockholders (or their family members) have a personal interest unrelated to 
their position as an officer or stockholder. 
 That portion of an investment in joint ventures, subsidiaries, affiliates 
and/or other related entities, which is carried at a value greater than equity, 
as adjusted (“equity, as adjusted” means the book value of the related entity 
reduced by the amount of unacceptable assets carried by the related entity). 
 All intangibles, such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, franchisee fees, 
organization costs, and so on, except unamortized servicing costs carried at 
a value established by an arm’s-length transaction and presented in 
accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles. 
 That portion of an asset not readily marketable and for which appraised 
values are very subjective carried at a value in excess of a substantially 
discounted appraised value.  Assets such as antiques, art work, and 
gemstones are subject to this provision and should be carried at the lower of 
cost or market. 
 Any asset that is principally used for the personal enjoyment of an officer or 
stockholder and not for normal business purposes.

Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. Purpose  A quality control (QC) plan must be submitted with every non-supervised 
lender’s application for automatic authority.  This exhibit outlines the criteria 
which the QC plan must satisfy.  Although supervised lenders are not 
required to submit a QC plan with their application, VA will review the QC 
plan when VA performs a lender audit. 
  
b. Audit  The QC plan must provide for: 
Program   
 a program of internal or external audit of the lender’s compliance with VA 
loan processing and underwriting requirements, or

requirements who have no direct loan processing or underwriting 
responsibilities. 
  
c. Adequate  The QC plan must provide: 
Scope   
 Audits or reviews are not less than ten percent of all VA-guaranteed 
mortgages originated by the lender monthly, including its branches and 
authorized agents except that lenders making more than 140 VA mortgages 
monthly may use statistical sampling methods in lieu of the ten percent. 
 Loans processed by all loan officers and underwriters and a random 
selection which includes loans from all branch offices and authorized 
agents.   
 Procedures for expanding scope when fraudulent activity or patterns of 
deficiencies are identified.  
 For lenders participating in LAPP, that reviews include the QC procedures. 
 Procedures for validating third party verification data obtained through 
Automated Underwriting Systems (AUS). 
 For each branch office that originates VA loans, an on-site branch office 
review should be conducted at least once annually.

Chapter 2:  Veteran’s Eligibility and Entitlement 
 
1.  How to Establish the Applicant’s Eligibility for a VA Loan 
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
a. What is  Eligibility means the Veteran meets the basic criteria of length of service 
Eligibility  (LOS) and character of service (COS) for the home loan benefit. Entitlement 
is the amount a Veteran has available for a guaranty on a loan.  An eligible 
Veteran must still meet credit and income standards in order to qualify for a 
VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
b. The  The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) issued in WebLGY is the proof of 
Lender’s Role  eligibility for the lender. 
 
The lender must ensure the applicant is an eligible Veteran before an appraisal 
is ordered, the loan cannot be processed or closed.  Lenders should never 
close a loan before they establish eligibility. VA cannot guarantee a loan for 
an ineligible Veteran.   
 
Once a COE is issued there may be conditions on the COE which must be met 
in order to receive a guaranty.  The conditions that could appear on the COE 
are: 
 
  Active Duty Service Member (ADSM) - Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of 
continuous active duty as of date of note is required. This COE is not 
valid if the ADSM was discharged after the date of the certificate. In 
this instance, a new COE must be obtained.   
  Funding Fee – Please fax a copy of VA Form 26-8937 to the Regional 
Loan Center (RLC) of Jurisdiction.  Please have the lender contact the 
RLC for loan processing. 
  Funding Fee – Veteran is not exempt from funding fee due to non-
service connected pension.  Loan application will require prior 
approval processing by VA.  
  Reserve or National Guard Member – Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to the date of this certificate.  A certification of 
continuous service in the Selected Reserve or National Guard as of the 
date of the note is required.

b. The    Reserve/National Guard Funding Fee – Entitlement is based on service 
Lender’s Role,  in the Selected Reserve and/or National Guard so an increased funding 
continued  fee is required. 
  Refinance Restoration – Restored entitlement previously used or 
charged for a VA Loan Indetification Number (LIN) as shown here is 
available only for use in connection with the property which secured 
that loan. 
  One-Time Restoration – Entitlement previously used for a VA LIN has 
been restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38 
U.S.C. 3702 (b)(4).  Any future restoration requires disposal of all 
property obtained with a VA loan. 
  Subsequent Use Funding Fee – Entitlement code of “5” indicates 
previously used entitlement has been restored.  The Veteran must pay a 
subsequent use funding fee on any future loan unless the Veteran is 
exempt. 
  Surviving Spouse – Eligibility of the surviving spouse and the validity 
of guaranty entitlement hereby evidenced will be null and void if any 
change in marital status occurs, subsequent to the date of this COE and 
prior to the date a loan to the widow or widower is closed, unless the 
lender making the loan was not aware of any change in marital status 
and obtained on the date the loan closed an affidavit from the surviving 
spouse in the form prescribed by the Secretary. 
  Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) – This certificate 
evidences eligibility under 38 U.S.C 3701 (b)(3) of the individual 
named as the spouse of a Servicemember missing in action or prisoner 
of war.  Any unused entitlement will terminate automatically upon the 
receipt of official notice that the Servicemember is no longer in a 
category specified in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(3) or upon dissolution of 
marriage. 
  Paid-in-Full Loan – Entitlement charged on a paid-in-full loan cannot 
be restored until the Veteran applies for restoration of entitlement.  The 
lender shall submit the application electronically through VA’s 
Automated Certificate of Eligibility (ACE) online application. 
  Foreclosed Loan – Entitlement charged on a foreclosed loan cannot be 
restored until VA’s loss on the loan has been fully repaid.  Information 
about repayment of the loss may be obtained by contacting an RLC.

b. The  Although this chapter discusses some of the basic eligibility criteria, it is not 
Lenders Role,  intended to provide a lender with all the knowledge necessary to make an 
continued  eligibility determination; consequently, all the various exceptions and nuances 
of eligibility are not included.  Appendix 1-A at the end of this chapter 
provides a quick reference and overview of basic eligibility criteria. 
 
Lenders must use VA’s ACE online application to obtain the COE. Go to 
VA’s Information Portal (VIP) and select WebLGY from the applications 
toolbar; then select Eligibility and follow the prompts.  In many cases, a COE 
can be generated in seconds.  If not, lenders should select the link to submit an 
electronic application.  This method allows lenders to upload supporting 
documentation and submit an application electronically to be processed by one 
of the RLCs. 
 
A Veteran can apply for a COE through eBenefits at 
http://www.ebenefits.va.gov or, if necessary, by completing VA Form 26- 
1880, Request for a Certificate of Eligibility and mailing it to the listed RLC.  
Simultaneous applications may delay COE processing. To ensure quicker 
responses, it is preferable to apply online. 
 
   
c. IRRRL  VA systems will not generate a VA case number for an Interest Rate 
Eligibility  Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL) if there is no record of an active VA 
Determination  loan.  This means if a lender successfully obtains a case number for an IRRRL, 
a COE is not required.

Change Date  March 28, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
   
The lender may rely on a COE as proof the Veteran is eligible for the home 
a. Eligibility 
loan benefit.  Although eligible for the home loan benefit, Veterans must still 
 
qualify based on income and credit before loan approval is granted. 
 
 
 
   
Entitlement is the amount available for use on a loan. The amount of basic 
b. Amount of 
entitlement is $36,000.  This may be reduced if a Veteran has used entitlement 
Entitlement 
before which has not been restored.  The amount of basic entitlement will be 
displayed near the center of the COE. For example it may say:    
                                                        
“THIS VETERAN’S BASIC ENTITLEMENT IS $_________ .  
TOTAL ENTITLEMENT CHARGED TO PREVIOUS VA 
LOANS IS $_______  .” 
 
For loans greater than $144,000, bonus entitlement may be available.  For 
loans greater than $144,000, but less than $484,350, the entitlement is 25 
percent.  For loans greater than $484,350, the maximum entitlement is 25 
percent of the loan limit, which can vary by county. For a list of loan limits by 
county, visit  http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/lenders.asp.  Please note 
county limits can change yearly.  VA will post the limits for each year on our 
website as they change. 
 
The Veteran may have entitlement for loans greater than 
$144,000, the COE does not reflect the bonus entitlement.  Instead, an asterisk 
by the word “available” refers to a note, which explains the possibility of 
additional entitlement. 
 
If the Veteran previously used entitlement, which has not been restored, 
available entitlement is reduced by the amount used on the prior loan(s).  The 
lender has three options in this situation: 
 
  Make the loan knowing that VA’s guaranty is limited to the amount of 
available entitlement, or 
  Have the Veteran apply for restoration of previously used entitlement, 
or 
  The Veteran may provide a downpayment in conjunction with their 
remaining entitlement.

3. How to Apply For A Certificate of Eligibility 
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019  
This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
a. Procedures  Lenders must first attempt to obtain a COE through the ACE application, 
which can be accessed through the VIP.   
 
If a COE cannot be obtained immediately, lenders should select the electronic 
application link that permits them to submit an electronic application. If the 
COE is issued with reduced entitlement and restoration is needed, use the 
“Correct COE” function to request an updated COE.   
 
The WebLGY system allows lenders to upload documentation, such as 
discharge papers or evidence to support restoration (Closing Disclosure, 
HUD-1 etc.), along with the electronic application. Lenders should not 
upload scanned documents without first completing an electronic application. 
Using this feature, rather than mail, is the preferred method, as it greatly 
reduces processing time. 
 
  Inability to obtain a COE in WebLGY does not mean the Veteran is 
ineligible, only that the system does not have sufficient information to 
make an automatic determination.  Lenders should always continue the 
application process as described in the preceding paragraph. 
  Application for an Unmarried Surviving Spouses. A surviving spouse 
of a Veteran, who dies on active duty or from service-connected 
causes, may still be eligible for a COE.  If the surviving spouse is 
remarried on or after age 57, and on or after December 16, 2003, they 
still may be eligible.  Eligibility may also be granted to the spouse of 
an active duty member who is listed as MIA or POW for at least 90 
days.  Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited to one-time 
use only.

a. Procedures,  a)  Surviving spouses of Veterans who died from non-service connected 
continued  causes may also be eligible if any of the following conditions are 
met:  (1) the Veteran was rated totally disabled for 10 years or more 
immediately preceding death; or (2) was rated totally disabled for 
not less than 5 years from date of discharge or release from active 
duty to date of death, or (3) the Veteran was a former POW who 
died after September 30, 1999, and was rated totally disabled for not 
less than 1 year immediately preceding death. The above eligibility 
requirements are determined by VA Compensation Department.  
Once completed, they will determine if the surviving spouse is 
eligible for qualifying Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC).  
b)  If applying for the first time, surviving spouses must complete VA 
Form 26-1817, Request for Determination of Loan Guaranty 
Eligibility-Unmarried Surviving Spouses, instead of VA Form 26-
1880. 
c)  Both the VA Form 26-1817 and WebLGY should be completed by 
using the name of the surviving spouse, date of birth, social security 
number, and then upload the VA Form 26-1817 in WebLGY.

Veterans  generally contain all the information needed for VA to make an eligibility 
(Regular  determination for persons who served on active duty of the a regular 
Military)  component of the Armed Forces.  The regular Armed Forces include active 
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard.  
 
  VA will accept legible copies of the DD214 Form. 
  Veterans separated after October 1, 1979, should furnish Member 
Copy 2, 4, 8, or any copy of a DD214 Form that includes the COS and 
the narrative reason for separation.  Veterans separated from military 
service after January 1, 1950, should have received  
DD214 Form. Veterans separated from active duty before January 1, 
1950, received documentation other than DD214 Form.  To be 
acceptable, it should indicate: 
 
a)  LOS, and 
b)  COS 
 
 
b. Veterans  Proof of service for Veterans on active duty is a Statement of Service (SOS) 
Still on Active  signed by, or by the direction of, the adjutant, personnel office, or commander 
Duty  of the unit or higher headquarters they are attached to. There is no one unique 
form used by the military for an SOS.  While an SOS is typically on military 
letterhead, it may also be electronic and both are acceptable.  The SOS must 
clearly show the: 
 
  Veteran’s full name, 
  social Security Number (SSN) or the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
  entry date on active duty, 
  duration of lost time, if any, and

c. Discharged  There is no one form used by the Reserves or National Guard that is similar to 
Reserve/  DD214 Form.  Selected Reserve describes a member or unit with the Ready 
Guard  Reserve designated by their respective services and approved by the Joint 
Members  Chiefs of Staff as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have 
priority over all other reserves. 
 
The National Guard is a unique element of the U.S. Military that serves both 
community and country.  Any state governor or the President of the United 
States can call on the Guard in a moments notice. 
 
Discharged members of the Army or Air National Guard may submit NGB 
Form 22, Report of Separation and Record of Service, and NGB Form 23B, 
Retirement Points Summary Statement, with the COS document.  Members of 
the Reserves should submit their points statement with COS. 
 
Typically, all members of the Reserves and/or Guard receive an annual 
retirement points summary which indicates the level and length of 
participation.  The applicant should submit the latest retirement point 
statement received, along with evidence of honorable service. 
 
VA will accept legible copies.

  the SSN or the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
  entry date of the applicant’s Reserve/Guard duty, and 
  the unit must state the creditable (actually drilled) years served in the 
Reserves or the National Guard.

to LOS  section.  For example, 1 day of service is sufficient for an individual who is 
discharged or released from service (regular active duty or Reserve/National 
Guard) due to a service-connected disability which would be listed on the 
discharge paperwork.  Because of the complexity and number of exceptions, 
this chapter does not attempt to cover all of them.  Because there are 
exceptions, lenders should not assume a Veteran is not eligible.  Instead, they 
should create an application and allow VA to make a formal determination of 
eligibility.

6. Restoration of Previously Used Entitlement 
   
a. Basic  Entitlement previously used in connection with a VA home loan may be 
Restoration  restored under certain circumstances.  Once restored, it can be used again for 
another VA loan.  Restoration of previously used entitlement is possible if: 
 
  property which secured the VA-guaranteed loan has been sold, and the 
loan has been paid in full; or 
  eligible Veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding 
balance on a VA loan and substitute his or her entitlement for the 
same amount originally used on the loan.  The assuming Veteran, 
substituting his/her entitlement, must also meet occupancy, income, 
and credit requirements.  This should be completed before requesting 
the Loan Guaranty Certificate in WebLGY, on the new loan. 
 
   
b. Special  In addition to the basic restoration criteria outlined above, a  
Restoration  Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on a prior VA loan 
Cases  under any of the following circumstances: 
 
  Regular “cash-out” refinance where the prior VA loan has been paid 
in full and the Veteran has made application for a refinance loan to be 
secured by the same property which secured the prior VA loan.  This 
includes refinancing situations, in which the prior loan will be paid off 
at closing from a VA refinancing loan on the same property, or 
  One –time restoration where the prior VA loan has been paid in full, 
but the Veteran has not disposed of the property securing the loan.  
The Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on the 
prior loan in order to purchase a different property, one time only.  
Once such restoration is used, the Veteran’s COE will indicate the 
one-time restoration.  The COE will also advise that any future 
restoration (purchase or cash-out refinance) will require disposal of all 
property or properties obtained with a VA loan. 
 
Example.  A Veteran used all his entitlement to purchase a home for 
$453,100 in a non-high cost county in Maryland.  Prior to job relocation to 
GA, he refinanced the loan to a non-VA loan.  The loan was paid in full; 
however, he still owned the property.  He now wants to purchase a home in 
GA and applies for a one-time restoration.  This is possible.  If the Veteran 
wants to use the benefit in the future for another purchase or regular “cash-
out” refinancing, both properties would have to be disposed of before 
entitlement can be restored.

• the reasonable value of the property indicated on the Notice 
of Value (NOV), and 
• the lenders needs in terms of secondary market 
requirements. 
Downpayment  No downpayment is required by VA unless the purchase price  3 of this 
exceeds the reasonable value of the property, or the loan is a  chapter 
Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM).  The lender may 
require a downpayment if necessary to meet secondary market 
requirements. 
Amount of  Guaranty is the amount VA may pay a lender in the event of  4 of this 
Guaranty  loss due to foreclosure.    chapter

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
• Subsection a has been updated to remove information on cooperative units. 
  
a. List of  The law authorizes VA to guarantee loans made to eligible veterans only for 
Eligible Loan  the following purposes: 
Purposes   
• To purchase or construct a residence, including a condominium unit to be 
owned and occupied by the veteran as a home: 
−  the loan may include simultaneous purchase of the land on which the 
residence is situated or will be situated, 
−  loans may also be guaranteed for the construction of a residence on land 
already owned by the veteran  (a portion of the loan may be used to 
refinance a purchase money mortgage or sales contract for the purchase of 
the land, subject to reasonable value requirements), and 
−  the residential property may not consist of more than four family units 
and one business unit except in the case of certain joint loans.  (See 
section 1 of chapter 7 for this exception.) 
• To refinance an existing VA-guaranteed or direct loan for the purpose of a 
lower interest rate. 
• To refinance an existing mortgage loan or other indebtedness secured by a 
lien of record on a residence owned and occupied by the veteran as a home. 
• To repair, alter, or improve a residence owned by the veteran and occupied 
as a home. 
• To simultaneously purchase and improve a home. 
• To improve a residence owned and occupied by the veteran as the veteran’s 
home through the installation of a solar heating system, a solar heating and 
cooling system, or a combined solar heating and cooling system, or through 
the application of a residential energy conservation measure.  These energy 
efficiency improvement loans can be made in conjunction with any type of 
VA purchase or refinancing loan. 
• To purchase a one-family residential unit in a condominium housing 
development approved by VA. 
• To purchase a farm residence to be owned and occupied by the veteran as a 
home.  If the loan includes the purchase of farmland, the farmland is 
appraised at its residential value only.  (See section 12 of chapter 11).

b. Ineligible  VA cannot guarantee loans made for ineligible loan purposes.  Examples of 
Loan Purposes  ineligible loan purposes include: 
 
• Purchase of unimproved land with the intent to improve it at some future 
date (that is, the land purchase is not in conjunction with a construction 
loan). 
• Purchase or construction of a dwelling for investment purposes. 
• Purchase or construction of a combined residential and business property, 
unless, 
−  the property is primarily for residential purposes, 
−  there is not more than one business unit, and 
−  the nonresidential area does not exceed 25 percent of the total floor area. 
• Purchase of more than one separate residential unit or lot unless the veteran 
will occupy one unit and there is evidence that: 
−  the residential units are unavailable separately, 
−  the residential units have a common owner, 
−  the residential units have been treated as one unit in the past, and 
−  the residential units are assessed as one unit, or 
−  partition is not practical, as when one unit serves the other(s) in some 
respect; for example, common approaches or driveways. 
 
c. Cash to  Cash to the veteran from loan proceeds is permissible only for certain types of 
Veteran  refinancing loans and under very limited circumstances, as follows: 
Generally Not   
an Eligible 
• For IRRRLs, see section 1 of chapter 6. 
Loan Purpose 
• For cash-out refinancing loans, see section 3 of chapter 6. 
 
For other types of refinancing loans and all purchase/acquisition loans, the 
veteran generally cannot receive cash from loan proceeds.  The only 
exception is the refund of items for which the veteran paid cash, which were 
subsequently included in the loan amount. 
 
Example:  Earnest money can be refunded to the veteran on a no-
downpayment loan.

Mortgage Association (GNMA) or whatever conduit they use to sell the 
loans.

b.  Because VA loans can be for the full reasonable value of the property, no 
Downpayment  downpayment is required by VA except in the following circumstances: 
 
• If the purchase price exceeds the reasonable value of the property, a 
downpayment in the amount of the difference must be made in cash from 
the borrower’s own resources, and 
• VA requires a downpayment on all GPMs. 
 
If a veteran has less than full entitlement available, a lender may require a 
downpayment in order to make the veteran a loan that meets GNMA or other 
secondary market requirements.  The “rule of thumb” for GNMA is that the 
VA guaranty, or a combination of VA guaranty plus downpayment and/or 
equity, must cover at least 25 percent of the loan.

4.  Maximum Guaranty on VA Loans 
  
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to note that Public Law 112-154 extended the 
temporary guaranty increase from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 
2014.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.   
  
a. Maximum  Public Law 112-154, the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp 
Guaranty Table  Lejeune Families Act of 2012, signed August 6, 2012, extended the 
temporary increase in the maximum guaranty.  The increase expired 
December 31, 2011, but Public Law 112-154, extended it through December 
31, 2014.  The maximum guaranty varies depending on the location of the 
property.  While VA does not have a maximum loan amount, there are 
effective “loan limits” for high-cost counties.  The limits are derived by 
considering both the median home price for a county and the Freddie Mac 
conforming loan limit.  To aid lenders in determining the maximum guaranty 
in high-cost counties, VA has created a Loan Limit chart, with instructions.  
This will be updated yearly. 
 
• In general, maximum guaranty, assuming the veteran has full entitlement, is 
as shown in the table below.

5.  Occupancy 
 
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• Subsection c has been updated to note that Public Law 112-154, the 
Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 
2012, signed August 6, 2012, expands occupancy to include dependent 
children.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.  
  
a. The Law on  The law requires a veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan to certify that he 
Occupancy  or she intends to personally occupy the property as his or her home.  As of the 
date of certification, the veteran must either 
 
• personally live in the property as his or her home, or 
• intend, upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the dwelling, to 
personally move into the property and use it as his or her home within a 
reasonable time. 
 
The above requirement applies to all types of VA-guaranteed loans except 
IRRRLs.  For IRRRLs, the veteran need only certify that he or she previously 
occupied the property as his or her home. 
 
Example:  A veteran living in a home purchased with a VA loan is transferred 
to a duty station overseas.  The veteran rents out the home.  He/she may 
refinance the VA loan with an IRRRL based on previous occupancy of the 
home. 
 
b. What is a  Occupancy within a “reasonable time" means within 60 days after the loan 
“Reasonable  closing.  More than 60 days may be considered reasonable if both of the 
Time?”  following conditions are met: 
 
• the veteran certifies that he or she will personally occupy the property as his 
or her home at a specific date after loan closing, and 
• there is a particular future event that will make it possible for the veteran to 
personally occupy the property as his or her home on a specific future date. 
 
Occupancy at a date beyond 12 months after loan closing generally cannot be 
considered reasonable by VA.

Spouse or  personally occupy the dwelling within a reasonable time.  In the case of a 
Dependent 
dependent child, the veteran’s attorney-in-fact or legal guardian of the 
Child 
dependent child must make the certification and sign VA Form 26-1820, 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement. 
 
Occupancy by the spouse may also satisfy the requirement if the veteran 
cannot personally occupy the dwelling within a reasonable time due to distant 
employment other than military service. In these specific cases, consult your 
Regional Loan Center (RLC) to determine if this type of occupancy meets 
VA requirements. 
 
Note:  The cost of maintaining separate living arrangements should be 
considered in underwriting the loan. 
 
For an IRRRL, a certification that the spouse or dependent child (or children) 
previously occupied the dwelling as a home will satisfy the requirement. 
 
 
d. Occupancy  Single or married servicemembers, while deployed from their permanent 
Requirements   duty station, are considered to be in a temporary duty status and able to 
for Deployed   meet the occupancy requirement.  This is true without regard to whether or

e. Occupancy  If the veteran states that he or she will retire within 12 months and wants a 
After  loan to purchase a home in the retirement location: 
Retirement   
• Verify the veteran’s eligibility for retirement on the specified date. 
- Include a copy of the veteran’s application for retirement submitted to his 
or her employer. 
• Carefully consider the applicant’s income after retirement. 
- If retirement income alone is insufficient, obtain firm commitments from 
an employer that meet the usual stability of income requirements. 
 
Note:  Only retirement on a specific date within 12 months qualifies.  
Retirement “within the next few years” or “in the near future” is not 
sufficient.

located within reasonable proximity of the veteran’s place of employment.  If 
the veteran’s employment requires the veteran’s absence from home a 
substantial amount of time, the following two conditions must be met: 
 
• the veteran must have a history of continuous residence in the community, 
and 
• there must be no indication that the veteran has established, intends to

time of loan closing (all loans).   
 
This satisfies the lender’s obligation to obtain the veteran’s occupancy 
certification. 
 
The lender may accept the occupancy certification at face value unless there 
is specific information indicating the veteran will not occupy the property as a 
home or does not intend to occupy within a reasonable time after loan closing. 
 
Where doubt exists, the test is whether a reasonable basis exists for 
concluding that the veteran can and will occupy the property as certified.

• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.

veteran to obtain the best available rate. 
 
b. Changes to  The lender and borrower are expected to honor any lock-in or other

Upon Interest  VA does not object to changes in the agreed upon rate, as long as no 
Rate 
lender/borrower agreements are violated.  The following procedure applies in 
such cases.  
 
Any increase in the interest rate of more than one percent requires: 
 
• re-underwriting to ascertain the veteran’s continued ability to qualify for the 
loan, 
• documentation of the change, and 
• a new or corrected Uniform Residential Loan Application, (URLA) with 
any corrections initialed and dated by the borrower.

a. Requirement  Veterans may pay reasonable discount points on VA-guaranteed loans.  The 
amount of discount points is whatever the borrower and lender agree upon.  
Discount points can be based on the principal amount of the loan after adding 
the VA funding fee, if the funding fee will be paid from loan proceeds. 
 
b. When Can  Discount points may be rolled into the loan only in the case of refinancing 
Points be  loans, subject to the following limitations: 
Included in the   
Loan? 
Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans  
A maximum of two discount points can be rolled into the loan. 
 
If the borrower pays more than two points, the remainder must be paid in 
cash. 
 
Refinancing of Construction Loans, etc. 
Loans to refinance are: 
 
• a construction loan, 
• an installment land sales contract, or 
• a loan assumed by the veteran at an interest rate higher than that for the 
proposed refinancing loan   
 
Any reasonable amount of discount points may be rolled into the loan as long 
as the sum of the outstanding balance of the loan plus allowable closing costs 
and discount points does not exceed the VA reasonable value.  
 
Reference:  See the maximum loan limitations in section 3 of this chapter. 
 
Cash-out Refinancing Loans 
While discount points cannot specifically be included in the loan amount, the 
borrower can receive cash from loan proceeds, subject to maximum loan 
limits (See section 3 of this chapter).  The cash received by the borrower can 
be used for any purpose acceptable to the lender, including payment of 
reasonable discount points.

a. Maximum  • Amortized loans:  30 years and 32 days,  
Maturity  • Nonamortized loans: 5 years. 
 
In addition, every loan must be repayable within the estimated economic life 
of the property securing the loan. 
 
The period for repayment of a loan is measured from the date of the note or 
other evidence of indebtedness. 
 
b. Maturity  VA regulations provide that any amounts, which fall due beyond the 
Extending  maximum maturity automatically, fall due on the maximum maturity date.   
Beyond the   
Maximum 
Thus, if a lender inadvertently makes a loan that exceeds the maximum 
maturity, it may still be subject to guaranty.   
 
However, the regulations also limit the amount that can be collected as a final 
installment, such as, they prohibit excessive ballooning.  The holder of a loan 
that violates this provision may desire to correct the situation through means 
which are legally proper in the jurisdiction.

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Requirement  All VA loans must be amortized if the maturity date is beyond 5 years from 
the date of the loan.  Loans with terms less than 5 years are considered term 
loans and need not be amortized. 
 
Generally, for amortized VA loans: 
 
• payments must be approximately equal, 
• principal must be reduced at least once annually, and 
• the final installment must not exceed two times the average of the preceding 
installments. 
 
Exceptions to these requirements are made in the case of: 
 
• GPMs – See section 7 of chapter 7, 
• Growing Equity Mortgages (GEMs) – See section 8 of chapter 7, 
• alternative amortization plans prior approved by VA, and 
• construction loans. 
 
b. Alternative  Certain amortization plans which do not meet the requirements described in 
Amortization  subsection a above may be used if approved in advance by VA.  A lender may 
Plans   submit an amortization plan to VA for prior approval if the plan: 
 
• is generally recognized; that is, is used extensively by established lending 
institutions, but 
• does not meet the requirements of approximately equal periodic payments 
and a reduction in principal not less often than annually. 
 
Exception:  GPMs and GEMs.

• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Protection  VA guarantees a portion of the loan, identified on the VA Loan Guaranty 
Against Loss  Certificate (LGC) by percentage and dollar amounts.  If a loss ultimately 
occurs on the loan, VA will reimburse the loan holder for all or part of such 
loss: 
 
• limited by the stated percentage and dollar amount of the guaranty, 
• limited by any VA maximums for reasonable and customary foreclosure 
expenses, and 
• subject to the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
b. Lender  It is the lender’s responsibility to comply with all laws and regulations related 
Responsibility  to the VA Home Loan program, and thereby prevent VA’s denial or reduction 
of a payment on a future claim.  A lender can accomplish this by ensuring that 
its employees who perform work related to VA lending: 
 
• understand and comply with VA policies, procedures and regulations, and 
applicable law, and 
• direct questions to VA when issues arise that are not addressed in this 
handbook or other materials provided by VA. 
 
c. When is a  A loan is automatically guaranteed by VA upon closing (prior to issuance of 
Loan that was  the LGC) provided the loan was made by: 
Closed   
Automatically 
• a supervised or a nonsupervised lender with automatic authority, and 
Guaranteed? 
• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations.

d. When is a  A prior approval loan is also guaranteed by VA upon closing (prior to 
Prior Approval  issuance of the LGC) provided: 
Loan   
Guaranteed?  
• the closed loan matches the proposed loan upon which the Certificate of 
Commitment was based, and 
• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations. 
  
e. What is  Evidence of guaranty is VA Form 26-1899, Loan Guaranty Certificate, which 
Evidence of  is generated electronically via VA’s webLGY application.  The LGC 
Guaranty?  represents tangible proof to the lender that VA’s guaranty is given in good 
faith.  It is contingent upon: 
 
• the veteran, property and purpose of the loan being eligible, 
• no fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the lender, and 
• the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
For example, VA may deny or reduce payment on a future claim based on the 
lender or holder’s noncompliance whether or not VA has issued evidence of 
guaranty on the loan. 
 
The LGC also has an audit indicator that, if noted Yes, lets the lender know 
the case has been identified for full review.  In these instances, the lender then 
needs to submit a complete loan origination package to the appropriate VA 
office for review.  Packages should be submitted within 15 days of the LGC 
being generated. 
 
f. Total Loss of  Willful fraud or material misrepresentation by the lender or holder, or by an 
Guaranty  agent of either, will relieve VA of liability for payment of any claim on the 
loan.  VA also has no liability in the case of: 
 
• forgery on the note, mortgage, loan application, or other loan documents, or 
• a Certificate of Eligibility or discharge papers that are counterfeited, 
falsified, or not issued by the Government. 
 
A holder of a VA loan who acquired the loan without notice or knowledge of 
fraud or material misrepresentation in procuring the guaranty will not be 
denied payment of any claim on the loan by reason of such fraud or material 
misrepresentation.

g. Partial Loss  A holder of a VA loan who fails to comply with applicable laws and 
of Guaranty  regulations may receive only partial payment of a claim if VA’s liability 
increases due to the holder’s noncompliance.  Material misrepresentation 
which is not willful has the same consequence.  
 
No claim will be paid on such loan until the amount of any increase in VA’s 
liability is known.  The burden of proof is on the holder to establish that VA’s 
increased liability is not due to the holder’s noncompliance or 
misrepresentation. 
 
Examples of noncompliance with applicable law and regulations which may 
lead to an increase in VA’s liability include: 
 
• failure to obtain and retain the required lien on property to secure the loan, 
• failure to include the power to substitute trustees, 
• failure to procure and maintain insurance coverage, 
• failure to advise VA as to default, 
• failure to provide notice of intention to begin foreclosure action, 
• failure to provide notice to VA in any suit or action, or notice of sale, 
• improper release, conveyance, substitution or exchange of security, 
• lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction, 
• failure to assure that escrowed/earmarked funds are expended in accordance 
with the agreement, and 
• failure to take into consideration limitations upon the quantum or quality of 
the estate or property.

a. Corrections  LGCs are generated using data entered from several sources, including the 
to LGCs  VA Funding Fee Payment System (VA FFPS).  If a lender discovers an error 
in reported data, such as date of loan closing, before they have generated the 
LGC, they must access the VA FFPS system to make the correction.  This 
will then result in the correct closing date being shown when the LGC is 
obtained.

to contact the appropriate VA RLC for assistance.  An LGC with minor 
typographical errors that do not compromise accurate identification of the

Change Date  February 22, 2019  
•  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  VA Underwriting Standards require lenders to always utilize the following 
Underwriting  guidance when underwriting VA-guaranteed loans: 
Information     
Lenders are encouraged to make VA loans to all qualified Veterans who apply.  
VA’s underwriting standards are intended to provide guidelines for 
underwriters.  Decisions must be based on sound application of the standards, 
and underwriters are expected to use good judgment and flexibility in applying 
underwriting guidelines.  Not all possible circumstances are addressed 
therefore, underwriters must apply reasonable judgment and flexibility in 
administering this important Veterans’ benefit. 
 
b. Basic  By law, VA may only guarantee a loan when it is possible to determine that 
Requirements  the Veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, and has present or verified anticipated 
income that bears a proper relation to the anticipated terms of repayment.  
VA’s underwriting standards are incorporated into VA regulations at  
38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and explained in this chapter.  This chapter addresses the 
procedures for verifications and analysis involved in underwriting a  
VA-guaranteed loan.  In the event the lender fails to perform their 
responsibilities, VA may take administrative actions including removal of 
authority to underwrite and close VA loans.

Procedures  defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 
commonly referred to as the E-sign Act. 
 
The procedures below address only the credit underwriting of the loan.   
Chapter 5 of this handbook provides all procedures that must be completed 
when making a VA loan.   
 
Step  Action 
1   Initiate the VA and Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System 
(CAIVRS) inquiries described in Topic 4, Subsection c of this  
chapter. 
2   Obtain all necessary verifications.   
 
The borrower’s authorization can be obtained separately for the 
lender’s required verifications, or on one blanket authorization form.  
  
The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) obtained from WebLGY 
provides verification of the amount of the Veteran’s available 
entitlement, verification of exempt/non-exempt from the VA Funding 
Fee, and the amount of VA monthly service connected disability 
compensation.  Order the COE before ordering the VA appraisal. 
 
The tri-merged credit report and verifications can be ordered by the 
lender or its agent or a party designated by the lender to perform that 
function.  However, these documents must always be delivered by the 
credit reporting agency or verifying party directly to the lender or its 
agent, and never to another party.  VA only permits the Veteran to 
pay for the credit report invoiced amount, not any additional costs 
that the lender may incur through other parties for obtaining the 
credit report.

• Subsection k has been updated for clarification.
It is the underwriter’s objective to identify and verify income available to 
a.  meet: 
Underwriter’s 
Objectives 
• the mortgage payment,
• other shelter expenses,
• debts and obligations, and
• family living expenses.
b.Effective Income is considered effective when it is determined to be verifiable, stable 
Income and reliable, and anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future. Income 
analysis is not an exact science.  It requires the lender to underwrite each loan 
on a case-by-case basis, using good judgement and flexibility when warranted.
To determine whether income is stable and reliable, the probability of 
continued employment must be determined through examination of the: 
• borrower’s past employment record,
• borrower’s training, education, and qualifications for his or her current
position, and/or
• type of employment.
Only verified income can be considered in the repayment calculation.

c. Spousal  Verify and treat the income of a spouse who will be contractually obligated on 
Income  the loan the same as you would the income of a Veteran borrower that will be 
obligated on the loan.  However, to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act (ECOA), do not ask questions about the income of the 
borrower’s spouse unless the: 
 
•  spouse will be contractually liable, 
•  borrower is relying on the spouse’s income to qualify, 
•  borrower is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance 
payments from the spouse or former spouse, or 
•  borrower resides and/or the property is in a community property state.  
 
In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be 
requested and considered in the same manner as for the borrower, even if the 
spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan.  See Topic 5, subsection 
a, of this chapter for additional guidelines for community property states when 
considering a spouse’s debts and credit history. 
 
The non-purchasing spouse’s (NPS) credit history does not need to be 
considered; however, the NPS’ liabilities must be considered to determine the 
extent of the household liabilities. 
 
d. ECOA  Always inform the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) that they do not have 
Considerations  to divulge information on the receipt of child support, alimony, or separate 
maintenance.  However, for this income to be considered in the loan analysis, 
it must be divulged and verified. 
 
Income cannot be discounted because of sex, marital status, age, race, or other 
prohibited bases under ECOA.

2 years, or 
•  provide an explanation of why 2 years of employment could not be 
verified,

on the qualification of the borrower(s).  
 
Use of Employment Verification Services 
 
Lenders may use any employment verification service that provides the same 
information as the “full” verification generated through the “Work Number” 
for all applicants. Generally, this will include the following information:

Alternative Verification Documentation 
 
Alternative documentation may be submitted in place of a VOE if the lender 
concludes that the borrower’s income is stable, reliable, and anticipated to 
continue for the foreseeable future; that is, if the borrower’s income qualifies 
as effective income.  Two years of employment with the same employer is not 
required to reach this conclusion. 
 
Alternative documentation consists of:  
 
•  paystub(s) covering at least the most recent 30-day period with year-to 
date information, 
•  W-2 Forms for the most recent 2 years, and/or 
•  telephone verification of the borrower’s current employment.

i. Income from  Verify commission income by obtaining the VOE or other written verification 
Commissions  which provides the following: 
 
•  the actual amount of commissions paid year-to-date, 
•  the basis for payments (salary plus commission, straight commission, or 
draws against commission, or other), and  
•  when commissions are paid bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, 
semiannually, annually, or other.  
•  individual income tax returns, signed and dated, plus all applicable 
schedules for the previous 2 years (or additional periods if needed to 
demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record). 
 
Analyze Income Derived from Commissions  
 
Generally, income from commissions is considered stable when the borrower 
has obtained such income for at least 2 years. Employment for less than 2 years 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous 
related employment and/or specialized training. Employment of less than 1 
year can rarely qualify; however, in-depth development is required for a 
conclusion of stable income on less than 1 year cases. 
 
For a borrower who will qualify using commission income of less than 25 
percent of the total annual employment income, IRS Form 2106 expenses are 
not required to be deducted from income even if they are reported on IRS Form 
2106. Additionally, the expenses are not required to be added as a monthly 
liability for the borrower. 
 
For a borrower earning commission income that is 25 percent or more of 
annual employment income, IRS Form 2106 expenses must be deducted from 
gross commission income regardless of the length of time the borrower has 
filed the expenses with the IRS.

necessary information for loan approval.  
 
Financial Statements, including a year-to-date Profit and Loss Statement and 
Balance Sheet must be completed after one-half of the tax-year has passed to 
verify current income and stability of the income.

j. Self- Analyze Income Derived from Self-Employment 
Employment   
Income  Generally, income from self-employment is considered stable when the 
Analysis 
borrower has obtained such income for at least 2 years. Less-than-2-years 
Guideline, 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous 
continued 
related employment and/or specialized training. Less-than-1-year can rarely 
qualify; however, in-depth development is required for a conclusion of stable 
income on less-than-1-year cases. 
 
Determine whether the business can be expected to generate sufficient income 
for the borrower’s future needs. 
 
If the business shows a steady or significant decline in earnings over the 
period analyzed, the reasons for such decline must be analyzed to determine 
whether the trend is likely to continue or be reversed. 
 
If it is difficult to determine the probability of continued operation, obtain 
documentation on the viability and potential future earnings, and an 
explanation of the function and financial operations of the business from a 
qualified party. 
 
Deductions and Expenses Claimed on Tax Returns 
 
Depreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns and financial 
statements of the business may be included in effective income. 
 
Business or roll over losses must be considered from all tax returns. 
 
What is reported to the IRS on a joint return must be used when applying for a 
federally guaranteed loan. 
 
On a joint tax return, the loss must be deducted from the borrower’s income in 
both community and non-community property states. 
 
On a joint tax return, when a borrower and co-borrower have been faced with 
business losses, the Veteran/borrower and his/her spouse may want to consider 
both being on the loan in order to potentially qualify.  The credit of both 
borrowers will be considered.

k. Active  For active-duty military borrowers, a Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) is 
Military  required instead of a VOE.  The LES must be an original, electronic, or a copy 
Borrower’s  certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original.     
Income 
 
The LES must furnish the same information as a VOE and must be no more 
than 120 days old (180 days for new construction), from the date of closing. 
 
For loans closed automatically, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of 
the date the note is signed (180 days for new construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of the 
date the application is received by VA (180 days for new construction).  
 
In addition, identify servicemembers who are within 12 months of release 
from active duty or the end of their contract term. For an enlisted 
servicemember, find the date of expiration (ETS) of the borrower’s current 
contract for active service on the LES.  For National Guard or Reserve 
members, find the ETS of the borrower’s current contract on the LES.  Also, if 
a National Guard or Reserve member is currently serving on active duty, also 
identify the expiration date of the current active-duty tour.  If the date is within 
12 months of the projected date that the loan will close, the loan package must 
also include one of the following items, or combinations of items, to be 
acceptable: 
 
•  documentation that the servicemember has already re-enlisted or 
extended his/her period of active duty to a date beyond the 12-month 
period following the projected closing of the loan, or 
•  documentation that the servicemember has already re-enlisted or 
extended his/her period of active-duty service to a date beyond the  
12-month period following the projected closing of the loan, or 
•  verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or 
verification of military retirement income following the release from 
active-duty service, or 
•  verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or 
verification of military retirement income following the release from 
active-duty service, or 
                                                                                         Continued on next page

k. Active  •  a statement from the servicemember that he/she intends to re-enlist or 
Military  extend his/her period of active-duty service to a date beyond the 12-
Borrower’s 
month period, plus (1) a statement from the servicemember’s 
Income, 
commanding officer confirming that the servicemember is eligible to 
continued 
re-enlist or extend his/her active-duty service as indicated, and (2) the 
commanding officer has no reason to believe that such re-enlistment or 
extension of active-duty service will not be granted, or  
•  documentation of other unusual strong positive underwriting factors, 
such as a downpayment of at least 10 percent from the borrower’s own 
assets (not a gift), a minimum of 6 months PITI, in cash, after the 
downpayment from the borrower’s own assets (not a gift) or clear 
evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a non-military 
spouse’s income so high that only minimal income from the active-duty 
servicemember is needed to qualify.  
 
If an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES, 
the above documentation is not required unless there is evidence that the 
Officer has resigned his or her commission.   
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates her ETS date listed on her 
LES is 171031 (October 31, 2017) and the projected date of closing is October 
1, 2017.  Therefore, one of the above items is needed to verify future income 
since her ETS date is less than 12 months from the projected date of closing. 
 
Example: A member of the Reserves has been called to Active Duty.  The 
ETS date on his LES indicates 181031 (October 31, 2018); however, his active 
duty orders indicate his active duty tour will not exceed the next 60 days.  
Therefore, since he will be leaving active duty before 12 months of the 
projected closing date, the active-duty income cannot be considered, and his 
civilian employment and drill duty will need to be considered. 
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates his ETS date is less than 1 
month from the anticipated date of closing, and he indicates he will be 
receiving military retirement and has accepted civilian employment.  Verify 
his future retirement income from the Department of Defense and verify future 
civilian employment with the Veteran’s new employer.

continued 
documentation submitted. If the borrower will not be re-enlisting, determine

regarding future sources of income.  
 
If an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES, 
the above documentation is not required unless there is evidence that the 
Officer has resigned his or her commission.   
 
Analysis of Military Quarters Allowance/ Basic Allowance for Housing 
(BAH) 
 
Include a military quarters allowance in effective income if properly verified. 
In most areas, there will be an additional variable housing allowance, which 
can also be included. The military quarters and variable housing allowances 
are not taxable income. The lender must verify the amount of BAH the 
Veteran will receive.  The BAH amount will change from one duty station to 
another. 
 
Ensure that the borrower meets the occupancy requirements set forth in 
Chapter 3 of this handbook.

Military  Clothing Allowances 
Borrower’s   
Income, 
Any subsistence (rations) and clothing allowances are indicated on the LES. 
continued 
The lender may include verified allowances in effective income.  These 
allowances are not taxable income. The clothing allowance generally appears 
on the LES as an annual amount.  Convert the annual amount to a monthly 
amount for the Loan Analysis. 
 
Verification and Analysis of Other Military Allowances 
 
To consider a military allowance in the underwriting analysis, obtain 
verification of the type and amount of the military allowance, how long the 
borrower has received it and the continuance into the foreseeable future. 
 
Military allowances may be included in effective income only if such income 
can be expected to continue because of the nature of the borrower’s assigned 
duties.  Such allowances include, but are not limited to:  
 
•  proficiency pay, such as linguistic, parachute, scuba, flight or hazard 
pay, and  
•  overseas or combat pay (sea pay, submarine, etc.) 
 
All types of allowances above are subject to periodic review and/or testing of 
the recipient to ascertain whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if 
it can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be 
expected to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, 
should the income be added to base pay. Contact the borrower’s chain of 
command if there are questions regarding the continuance of the income. 
 
If the duration of the military allowance cannot be determined, this source of 
income may still be used to offset short term obligations of 6 to 24 months 
duration. 
 
Consult the IRS to determine if any allowances for pay are considered taxable 
income by the IRS, unlike housing, clothing, and subsistence allowances.

Income from Recently Activated Members of the Reserve or National 
Guard 
 
Lenders must consider if a borrower, whose income is being used to qualify 
for a loan, may have a change in income due to participation in a 
Reserves/National Guard unit subject to activation. 
 
If an activated Reserves/National Guard member applies for a loan, they must 
present orders indicating their current active duty tour is not to exceed 12 
months.   
 
Example: The borrower’s full-time civilian employment is $3,000 per month.  
The borrower’s current income from the Reserves due to activation is $3,500 
per month and orders are for 12 months.  Since the borrower’s full-time 
civilian employment is only $3,000 per month, the $3,000 should be used to 
qualify the borrower. 
 
There are not any clear-cut procedures that can be applied to all cases.  
Evaluate all aspects of each individual case, including credit history, 
accumulation of assets, overall employment history, and make the best 
decision for each loan regarding the use of income in qualifying for the loan.  
 
It is very important that loan files be carefully and thoroughly documented, 
including any reasons for using or not using Reserve/National Guard income 
in these situations. 
 
As a lender, the goal is to provide the Veteran their benefit without placing 
him/her in a financial hardship.

VA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be 
documented for the likelihood of continuance. 
 
VA disability income verification will be placed on the COE.  However, there 
are some instances where this income is not placed on the COE which may 
include if the Veteran: 
 
•  will be discharging within the next 6 months from the military and has 
completed a Physical Exam Board (PEB) or Medical Review Board 
(MEB) and will be filing for VA disability while still on active duty, 
•  has recently filed for VA disability and VA’s Compensation Service 
has not yet made a determination and would be entitled to receive VA 
disability benefits, 
•  would be entitled to receive VA disability benefits, but for the receipt 
of retired pay, 
•  has received VA disability benefits in the past, or 
•  is an unmarried surviving spouse of a Veteran who is eligible for or 
receiving qualifying Disability and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), or 
•  is in receipt of a VA nonservice connected pension, or  
•  has a VA-appointed Fiduciary to handle financial matters. 
 
If the Veteran falls under one of the above categories, perform the following: 
 
•  Submit by fax VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA Benefits, to the 
VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) where the subject property is located.  
VA will complete and return the form to the lender by return fax.

automatic procedure, until the lender obtains the completed form from VA 
when the Veteran or surviving spouse is under one of the above categories in 
subsection m of this topic. The lender must maintain the completed form with 
the loan package. 
 
If the form indicates that the borrower receives a non service-connected 
pension or has a VA Fiduciary, the loan cannot be closed automatically.  The 
loan must be uploaded in WebLGY for prior approval.  See Chapter 5 of this 
handbook for the necessary documentation that must be submitted to VA.   
 
VA must review, underwrite, and issue a Certificate of Commitment before 
the loan can close.  See Chapter 5 of this handbook for prior approval 
procedures. 
         
VA’s Pension Service may also have to review and/or approve the application 
in addition to Loan Production.  The VA RLC will coordinate with the Pension 
Service upon receipt of the underwriting package.

m. Verification  Analysis of Prospects for Continued Employment 
and Analysis of   
Income of  Cases involving recently discharged Veterans often require the underwriter to 
Recently 
exercise a great deal of judgment and flexibility in determining whether the

Military, 
continued  income, or insufficient retirement income, to support the loan obligation.  If 
the duties the borrower performed in the military are similar or directly related 
to the duties of the present position, use this as one indicator that the 
employment is likely to continue. 
 
Most cases fall somewhere between these extremes.  Fully develop the facts of 
each case to make a determination.  The guidelines under Self-Employment 
Income in Topic 2, subsection j of this chapter provide guidance for a recently

likelihood of continuance. 
 
Verification of Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Home 
 
Obtain a copy of the rental agreement for the property, if any. 
 
Analysis using Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Loan 
 
Use the prospective rental income only to offset the mortgage payment on the 
rental property, and only if there is not an indication that the property will be 
difficult to rent. This rental income may not be included in effective income. 
 
Obtain a working knowledge of the local rental market.  If there is not a lease 
on the property, but the local rental market is very strong, the lender may still 
consider the prospective rental income for offset purposes.  Provide a 
justification on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
       
Reserves are not needed to offset the mortgage payment on the property the 
Veteran occupies prior to the new loan. 
 
Example: The Veteran’s current home has a VA mortgage with a monthly 
PITI payment of $1,000.  Bonus entitlement is being used to purchase a new 
primary residence and the Veteran will rent the previous home for $1,200 
monthly upon closing of the new home.  The payment of $1,200 can be used 
to offset the existing mortgage payment, if all the above conditions are met.  
The additional rent received in excess of the mortgage payment cannot be used 
as effective income. 
 
Verification of Rental Property Income 
 
Obtain the following: 
 
•  documentation of cash reserves totaling at least 3 months mortgage 
payments (PITI), and 
•  individual income tax returns, signed and dated or lender obtained tax 
transcripts, plus all applicable schedules for the previous 2 years, 
which show rental income generated by the property.

as taxes, hazard insurance, flood insurance, homeowner’s association fees, and 
any other recurring fees should be documented for the property(ies). 
 
Equity in the property cannot be used as reserves.  
 
Cash proceeds from a VA refinance cannot be counted as the required PITI on 
a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the borrower’s account before 
the new VA loan closes. 
 
Gift funds cannot be used to meet reserve requirements. 
 
Analysis of Rental Property Income 
 
Each property(ies) must have a 2-year rental history itemized on the 
borrower’s tax return. 
 
Property depreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns may be 
included in effective income.  
 
If after adding depreciation to the negative rental income, the borrower still 
has rental loss, the negative income should be deducted from the overall 
income as it reduces the borrower’s income. 
 
If rental income will not, or cannot be used, then the full mortgage payment 
should be considered and reserves do not need to be considered.

continued  The Veteran/borrower must occupy one unit as his/her residence.  
 
For purposes of determining the VA guaranty, lenders are instructed to 
reference only the One-Unit Limit column in the FHFA Table “Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac Maximum Loan Limits for Mortgages, located at 
https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads. 
 
Verify cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI), and 
documentation of the borrower’s prior experience managing rental units and/or 
use of a property management company to oversee the property. 
 
Analysis of Multi-Unit Property Securing the VA loan (Veteran will 
occupy one unit as his/her residence) 
 
Include the prospective rental income in effective income only if: 
 
•  the borrower has a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and 
•  cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI). 
 
If each unit is separate and not under one mortgage, 6 months PITI must be 
verified for each separate unit. 
 
Equity in the property cannot be used as reserves to meet PITI requirements.  
This must be the borrower’s own funds, not a gift. 
 
Cash proceeds from a VA regular “Cash-Out” refinance cannot be counted as 
the required PITI on a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the 
borrower’s account before the new VA loan closes. 
 
The amount of rental income to include in effective income is based on 75 
percent of the amount indicated on the lease or rental agreement unless a 
greater percentage can be documented (existing property). 
 
The amount of rental income to include in effective income is based on 75 
percent of the amount indicated on the appraiser’s opinion of the property’s 
fair monthly rental (proposed construction).

Analysis of Temporary Boarder Rental Income                                          
 
Include rental income in effective income only if the borrower has a 
reasonable likelihood of continued success due to the strength of the local 
market.  Provide a justification on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
PITI reserves are not necessary to consider the income, and all the income may

q. Automobile  Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related 
or Similar  to a borrower’s employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset 
Allowances  a corresponding car payment.  However, if the borrower reports an allowance 
as part of monthly qualifying income, it must be determined if the automobile 
expense reported on IRS Form 2106 should be deducted from income or 
treated as a liability. 
 
If the reported expense is less than the automobile allowance, the amount can 
be treated as income and added to borrower’s monthly income.  
 
If the reported expense exceeds the automobile allowance, the amount must be 
deducted from income as a net calculation in Section D on VA Form 26-6393, 
Loan Analysis. 
 
Likewise, any other similar type of allowance received by the borrower should 
be considered with regards to the tax returns for determination of an offset of 
the corresponding obligation, as income, or as an expense.

r. Other Types  While not all types of income can be listed, documentation of income must 
of Income  support the history of receipt and the likelihood or continuance of the income 
for at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date to include in effective 
income.  Otherwise, consider whether it is reasonable to use the income to 
offsets short term obligations of 6 to 24 months duration. 
 
“Other” types of income which may be considered as effective income 
include, but are not limited to:  
 
•  pension or other retirement benefits,  
•  disability income, 
•  dividends from stocks or other, 
•  interest from bonds, savings accounts, or others, 
•  royalties, 
•  notes receivable, and 
•  trusts 
 
VA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be 
documented for the likelihood of continuance. A COE will generally have the 
amount of VA disability income listed, however, see Topic 2, subsection m of 
this chapter for exceptions. 
 
A VA award letter or bank statement may also verify the current monthly 
amount received. 
 
The lender may include verified income from public assistance programs in 
effective income if evidence indicates it will likely continue for 3 years or 
more. 
 
The lender may include workers’ compensation income that will continue for 
at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date if the borrower chooses to 
reveal it.  
 
The lender may include verified income received specifically for the care of 
any foster child(ren), only to balance the expenses of caring for the foster 
child(ren) against any increased residual requirements.

r. Other Types  Example: The borrower(s) receive a stipend paid by the county or State for 
of Income,  two foster children living in the residence.  Instead of considering a family size 
continued  of four, a family size of two should be used to determine the residual income 
requirement. 
Do not include temporary income items such as VA educational allowances 
(including the Post 9/11 GI Bill benefit) and unemployment compensation in 
effective income.   
Exception: If unemployment compensation is a regular part of a borrower’s 
income due to the nature of his/her employment (for example, seasonal work), 
it may be included. 
 
A borrower in receipt of VA Pension or Disability benefits with Aid and 
Attendance should be discussed with the VA Pension Service, VA 
Compensation Service, or the VA Hospital where the property is located, to 
determine if the income is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.   
 
If a borrower has a contract for employment in a foreign country (whether or 
not the employer is a US company or corporation), the income can be used if it 
is verified, stable, and reliable.  While some contracts are renewed yearly, 
consider the borrower’s past employment history and the likelihood of the 
contract being extended.   
 
Income that is paid by a foreign employer or government in foreign currency 
should be converted to US dollars.

Change Date 
•  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
   
a. Income Tax  Determine the appropriate deductions for Federal income tax and Social 
and Social  Security using the “Employer’s Tax Guide”, Circular E, issued by the Internal 
Security  Revenue Service (IRS).   
Deductions   
Determine the appropriate deductions for state and local taxes using similar 
materials provided by the states.   
 
The income tax should be based upon the borrower’s residence and what is 
documented in the guide to the IRS, and not solely the amount claimed on the 
paystub. 
 
An active-duty servicemember’s LES may have a different state tax deduction 
than the state where the active-duty servicemember will be purchasing a 
residence or refinancing.  Select the state listed on the LES for the state taxes 
to be considered in state tax deductions. 
 
The lender may consider the borrower’s potential tax benefits from obtaining 
the loan (for example, mortgage interest deduction) in the analysis. To do so: 
 
•  determine what the borrower’s withholding allowance will be, using 
the instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W-4, Employee’s 
Withholding Allowance Certificate, and 
•  apply that withholding number when calculating Federal and state 
income tax deductions on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, then 
•  document the change in deductions in Item 47, Remarks, on VA Form 
26-6393, Loan Analysis.

b. Income Tax  MCCs issued by state and local governments may qualify a borrower for a 
Credits from  Federal tax credit.  The Federal tax credit is based on a certain percentage of 
Mortgage  the borrower’s mortgage interest payment.  Lenders must provide a copy of 
Credit 
the MCC to VA with the loan package which indicates: 
Certificates 
 
(MCC) 
•  documentation verifying any expenses charged by the local 
government entity for the program which is listed on the Closing 
 
Disclosure Statement, and 
  the percentage to be used to calculate the tax credit, and if applicable, the 
amount of the indebtedness.  The certified indebtedness can be comprised of a 
  loan incurred by the borrower to acquire a principal residence or a qualified 
home improvement rehabilitation loan. 
 
 
There is an IRS annual limit on the tax credit equal to the lesser of the 
 
borrower’s maximum tax liability or $2,000.  Calculate the tax credit by 
applying the specified percentage to the interest paid on the certified 
 
indebtedness.  Then apply the annual limit. 
    
Example: The MCC shows a 30 percent rate and $100,000 certified 
  indebtedness.  The borrower will pay approximately $8,000 in annual 
mortgage interest.  The borrower’s estimated total Federal income tax liability 
 
is $9,000.  Calculate the tax credit as follows: 
 
Step  Procedure 
1  30 percent of $8,000 = $2,400 
2  Apply the IRS annual $2,000 limit 
3  The tax credit will be $2,000 
This allows use of $167 (one-twelfth of $2,000) as income to qualify the 
borrower. 
 
If the mortgage on which the borrower pays interest is greater than the amount 
of certified indebtedness, limit the interest used in the tax credit calculation to 
that portion attributable to the certified indebtedness. 
 
Since these programs are offered by state and local government(s), pre-
approval by VA is not required for the borrower to participate in the program.  
The lender is responsible to determine all eligibility requirements are met by 
the borrower to participate in the program.

Amount of 
 
Cash Required 
•  any closing costs, pre-paids, or discount points which are the 
for Closing 
borrower’s responsibility and are not financed into the loan, and 
•  the difference between the sales price and the loan amount, if the sales 
price exceeds the reasonable value established by VA (i.e. negative 
equity).   
 
VA does not require the borrower(s) to have additional cash to cover a certain 
number of mortgage payments, unplanned expenses or other contingencies on 
the residence, or refinance of the Veteran’s residence.   
 
However, the borrower’s ability to accumulate liquid assets and the current 
availability of liquid assets for unplanned expenses should be considered in the 
overall credit analysis. 
 
Reserves are required for borrowers using rental income to qualify.  See Topic 
2, subsection n of this chapter for more information.   
 
A rental offset does not require additional assets to cover PITI.  See Topic 2, 
subsection n of this chapter for more information.   
 
The assets securing a loan(s) against deposited funds (signature loans, cash 
value life insurance policies, 401(k) loans, other) may not be included as an 
asset on the VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis.  See Topic 5 of this chapter for

Requirements 
Request for Verification of Deposit, or electronic, or certified copies of the 
borrower’s last two bank statements. 
 
Verifications must be no more 120 days old (180 days for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans, this means the date of the deposit verification 
is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the deposit verification is 
within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for 
new construction). 
 
c. Pending Sale  In some cases, the determination that the income and/or assets of borrowers 
of Real Estate  are needed to qualify for the loan depends upon the sale of presently the 
borrower’s owned real property.   
 
The sale proceeds may be necessary to: 
 
•  clear the outstanding mortgage(s) against the property, 
•  pay outstanding consumer obligations,  
•  make a downpayment or pay closing costs on the VA loan, and/or 
•  restore previously used VA entitlement.  
 
Evidence the sale has been completed should be included in the closing 
package to verify proceeds from the sale.    
 
As an alternative, the Veteran may sell the property with the buyer assuming 
the outstanding mortgage obligation.  See Chapter 6 of this handbook for 
assumptions (Release of Liability) with a Substitution of Entitlement to restore 
previously used entitlement. 
 
See Chapter 5 of this handbook for prior approval loans, which depend upon 
the sale of property for the borrower to qualify.

Change Date  February 22, 2019  
  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
 
 
a. Verification 
All debts and obligations of the borrowers’ must be verified and rated. Obtain 
Requirements 
a credit report with all information for all credit bureaus.   See Topic 7, 
for Debts and 
Obligations  subsection a of this chapter for details on the type of credit report required.  
For obligations not included on the credit report which are revealed on the 
application or through other means, the lender must obtain a verification of 
payment history showing the obligation or other written verification directly 
from the creditor, including the payment amount and outstanding balance.  
The lender must also separately verify accounts listed as “will rate by mail 
only” or “need written authorization.” 
 
When a pay stub(s) or LES indicates an allotment, the lender must investigate 
the nature of the allotment to determine whether the allotment is related to a 
debt or other obligation(s).  Examples may include 401K obligation or 
repayment, child care, child support, or other.  
 
For obligations that have not been rated on the credit report or elsewhere, 
obtain the verification and rating directly from the creditor.  Include a written 
explanation for any obligation that is not rated. 
 
Resolve all discrepancies prior to closing.  If the credit report, deposit 
verification, bank statement, or pay stub(s) reveals any debts or obligations 
which were not divulged by the borrowers): 
 
•  obtain clarification as to the status of such debts from the borrower(s), 
then 
•  verify any remaining discrepancies with the creditor. 
 
Credit reports and verifications must be no more than 120 days old (180 days 
for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans, this means the date of the credit report or 
verification is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the credit report or verification 
is within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for

If either of these situations is applicable, the lender must: 
 
•  Obtain a credit report on the non-purchasing spouse in addition to the 
Veteran’s credit report. 
•  Consider the spouse’s credit history in reaching a determination.  A 
Veteran borrower with a satisfactory credit history may be considered a 
satisfactory risk even though the non-purchasing spouse’s credit may 
be unsatisfactory.  
•  Include the monthly payment of the non-purchasing spouse’s debts on 
the VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. For debts such as judgments and 
unpaid collection accounts, lenders should consider the Veteran’s 
capacity to address the debt(s).  
•  Develop the facts surrounding any unsatisfied judgments on the 
spouse’s credit report, such as where the judgment was filed and 
whether the parties were married to one another at the time, and secure 
a competent legal opinion whether the judgment may become a lien 
against the property. 
•  Exclude the monthly payment on the spouse’s debts from the loan 
analysis when a reliable source of income for the spouse is verified to 
reach such a conclusion which is voluntarily provided. 
•  Document VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, with an explanation of 
facts and determination when concluding credit worthiness of the 
Veteran or excluding obligations of the non-purchasing spouse.

of Alimony and  borrower must be verified. 
Child Support   
Obligations 
Do not request documentation of a borrower’s divorce unless it is necessary to 
verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the 
borrower.  If, however, in the routine course of processing the loan, the lender 
encounters direct evidence (such as, in the credit report) that a child support or 
alimony obligation exists, they should make any inquiries necessary to resolve 
discrepancies and obtain the appropriate verification. 
 
Spousal support may be treated as a reduction in income on VA Form 26-
6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
Child support payment is treated as a liability on VA Form 26-6393, Loan 
Analysis. 
 
c. Analysis of  Significant debts and obligations include: 
Debts and   
Obligations 
•  debts and obligations with a remaining term of 10 months or more; that 
is, long-term obligations, and 
•  accounts with a term of less than 10 months that require payments so 
large as to cause a severe impact on the family’s resources for any 
period of time. 
 
Example: Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a 
remaining balance of $1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months, 
would be considered significant.  The payment amount is so large as to cause a 
severe impact on the family’s resources during the first, most critical, months 
of the home loan. 
 
Determine whether debts and obligations which do not fit the description of 
“significant” should be given any weight in the analysis.  They may have an 
impact on the borrower’s ability to provide for family living expenses.

f. Secondary  If the borrower(s) provides written evidence that the student loan debt will be

continued  does not need to be considered. 
 
If a student loan is in repayment, or scheduled to begin within 12 months from 
the date of VA loan closing, the lender must consider the anticipated monthly 
obligation in the loan analysis and utilize the payment established by 
calculating each loan at a rate of five percent of the outstanding balance 
divided by 12 months. 
 
Example:  A borrower has a $25,000 student loan balance and you multiple it 
by 5%, which equals $1,250.  This amount ($1,250) is divided by 12 months to 
equal a monthly payment of $104.17.  
 
If the payment(s) reported on the credit report for each student loan(s) is 
greater than the threshold payment calculation above in a above, the lender 
must use the payment recorded on the credit report. 
   
If the payment(s) reported on the credit report is less than the threshold 
payment calculation above, in order to count the lower payment, the loan file 
must contain a statement from the student loan servicer that reflects the actual 
loan terms and payment information for each student loan(s). 
 
The statement(s) must be dated within 60 days of VA loan closing, and may be 
an electronic copy from the student loan servicer’s website or a printed 
statement provided by the student loan servicer.

plan in effect prior to the lender’s inquiry, 
•  the Veteran’s overall credit history and anticipated financial capacity 
after the proposed loan is made indicate a reasonable likelihood that

Examples 
 
Consideration would be given to a Veteran with an outstanding/excellent 
credit history and adequate income whose debt balance is too large to be

Reporting 
More information can be found at:       
System 
http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/caivrs 
(CAIVRS)? 
 
The database includes default information from the Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Education, Department of Justice, HUD, Small Business 
Administration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and VA. 
   
The VA default information included in the database relates to: 
 
•  overpayments on education cases, 
•  overpayments on disability benefits income, and 
•  claims paid due to home loan foreclosures which resulted in a debt of 
the government (Generally type 2 VA loans). 
 
CAIVRS Procedures 
 
A CAIVRS inquiry must be performed for all borrowers and co-borrowers 
(Veteran or non-Veteran) on all VA loans, including IRRRLs. The one 
exception to this policy is that CAIVRS is not required for non-purchasing 
spouses in community property states. 
 
VA assigns a 10-digit VA lender identification number (ID) to each new 
lender, then automatically forwards the ID number to HUD with a request to 
grant the lender CAIVRS access.  The lender can begin accessing CAIVRS 
usually between 7 to 10 business days after receiving its VA ID number 
assignment. 
 
To register for CAIVRS access for first time users, please use the following 
link: https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/f57register.cfm. 
 
Please direct questions concerning problems encountered with accessing 
CAIVRS to caivrs_admin@hud.gov.  
 
If the borrower(s) is found to have a delinquent federal debt through CAIVRS, 
the validity and delinquency status of the debt should be verified by contacting 
the creditor agency using the contact phone number and case number reflected 
on the borrower’s CAIVRS report.

Federal Debts 
•  Suspend processing of the loan application to determine the reason for 
the non “A” number.  
•  Give full consideration to the CAIVRS information, and any 
subsequent clarifying information or documentation provided, in 
applying VA credit standards.  Any non “A” number received does not 
automatically disqualify a Veteran from using their home loan benefit; 
however, the lender must document and justify the approval. See Topic 
7, subsection b of this chapter for documentation and explanation 
requirements. 
•  If a previous VA loan is involved that resulted in a debt to the 
government (due to foreclosures, short sale, deed in lieu, or other), the 
borrower may contact the VA Debt Management Center at 1-800-827-
0648 or at dmc.ops@va.gov to make arrangements to repay the debt. 
 
Generally, only type 2 VA loans (fifth digit of the VA loan number) result in a 
debt to VA and are reported.  The Veteran’s entitlement cannot be restored 
until the debt to VA is paid in full.

paid in full.    
 
Each agency has their timeliness requirements before removing a non “A” 
CAVIRS finding.  This does not preclude the Veteran or borrower from 
receiving a VA loan if credit standards are met for VA loans.  See Topic 4.07b 
(13 and 14) of this Chapter for guidelines after a bankruptcy or foreclosure. 
 
Example:  A borrower suffered a loss on a FHA loan home loan 2 years ago.  
While HUD has not removed the CAIVRS finding as the 3-year waiting period 
has not passed for FHA, the lender is eligible to continue processing a VA 
loan without an “A” CAIVRS finding due to the borrower(s) meeting VA 
credit guidelines for foreclosures and documented in the loan file. 
 
CAIVRS information is only for the lender’s and borrower’s use in processing 
the loan application.  Only those persons having responsibility for screening 
borrowers and/or co-borrowers may use CAIVRS.  Any other use is 
unauthorized. 
 
e. Treatment of  A borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she is 
Federal Debts  presently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government until 
the delinquent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangement 
have been made between the borrower and the Federal agency. 
 
Example:  A borrower has delinquent taxes and payments have not been made 
for several years.  The establishment of a payment plan after the CAVIRS 
finding has been addressed may not be sufficient to show a satisfactory 
payment arrangement to repay the obligation. 
 
A borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she has a 
judgment lien against his or her property for a debt owed to the Government 
until the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied.

7. Credit History – Required Documentation and Analysis 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019  
  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
 
Credit Reports used in analyzing VA loans must be either Three-file Merged 
a. Credit 
Credit Reports (MCR), or Residential Mortgage Credit Reports (RMCR). 
Report 
 
Standards 
The credit report must be less than 120-days old (180 days for new 
construction).  For automatically closed loans and prior approval loans, the 
date of the credit report must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed 
(180 days for new construction). 
 
If an RMCR is used, the standards applicable to a RMCR include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
 
•  The report must be prepared by a reputable credit reporting agency. 
•  Each account with a balance must have been checked with the creditor 
within 90 days of the date of the credit report. 
 
For each debt listed, the report must provide the creditor’s name, date the 
account was opened, high credit, current status, required payment, unpaid 
balance, and payment history. 
 
The report must name at least two national repositories of credit records 
contacted for each location in which the borrower has resided during the most 
recent 2 years (separate repository inquiries are required for any co-borrowers 
with individual credit records). 
 
The report must include all available public records information that is not 
considered obsolete under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681) 
such as bankruptcies, judgments, law suits, foreclosures and tax liens. 
 
The RMCR must be an original or electronic report, with no erasures, 
whiteouts, or alterations. 
 
The report must contain a 24-month employment and residency history. 
 
VA may decline to accept a credit report which does not meet these standards. 
 
If possible, the cost of the credit report must be listed on the credit report.  If 
not possible, an itemized invoice identifying the borrower(s) is required to 
verify the cost on the Closing Disclosure Statement (CD) when charging the 
borrower for the credit report.

Analyze Credit  his or her willingness to repay future obligations.  Emphasis should be on the 
borrower’s overall payment patterns rather than isolated occurrences of 
unsatisfactory repayment.  Determine whether the borrower (and spouse, if 
applicable) is a satisfactory credit risk based on a careful analysis of the credit 
report and other credit data. 
 
VA does not have a minimum credit score requirement.    
 
Rent and Mortgage Payment History 
 
The borrower’s most recent 24-month rental history and any outstanding, 
assumed, or recently retired mortgages must be verified and rated.  Housing 
expense payment history is often a primary indicator of how motivated the 
borrower is to make timely mortgage payments in the future.   
 
Absence of Credit History 
 
For borrower(s) with no established credit history, base the determination on 
the borrower’s payment record on alternative or nontraditional credit directly 
from the borrower or creditor in which a payment history can be verified.  
Absence of a credit history is not generally considered an adverse factor.   
 
It may result when: 
 
•  borrower(s) has not yet developed a credit history,  
•  borrower(s) has routinely used cash rather than credit, and/or 
•  borrower(s) has not used since some disruptive credit event such as 
bankruptcy or debt pro-ration through consumer credit counseling.

b. How to  Adverse Credit Data 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  In circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally 
considered to be re-established after the borrower(s), have made satisfactory 
payments for 12 months after the date the last derogatory credit item was 
satisfied.  If a credit report reveals numerous unpaid collections and/or 
accounts that are not being paid timely, including some which have been 
outstanding for many years, then once the borrower has satisfied the 
obligations, and then makes timely payments on subsequent obligations for at 
least 12 months, satisfactory credit is considered re-established.   
 
Collection Accounts 
 
Isolated collection accounts do not necessarily have to be paid off as a 
condition for loan approval.  A credit report may show numerous satisfactory 
accounts and one or two unpaid medical (or other) collections.  In such 
instances, while it would be preferable to have collections paid, it would not 
necessarily be a requirement for loan approval.   
 
However, collection accounts must be considered part of the borrower’s 
overall credit history and unpaid collection accounts should be considered 
open, recent credit.   
 
Borrowers with a history of collection accounts should have re-established 
satisfactory credit in order to be considered a satisfactory credit risk.   
 
While VA does not require that collection accounts be paid-off prior to closing 
if the borrower’s overall credit is acceptable, an underwriter must address the 
existence of the collection account(s) with an explanation on VA Form 26-
6393, Loan Analysis, for excluding the negative credit history they represent.    
 
If the collection account is listed on the credit report with a minimum 
payment, then the debt should be recognized at the minimum payment amount.

b. How to  Charged off Accounts 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  These accounts are typically collections in which the creditor is no longer 
pursuing collection of the account.  The underwriter must address the 
circumstances regarding the negative credit history when reviewing the overall 
credit of the borrower(s). 
 
Disputed Accounts 
 
Lenders may consider a Veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses 
regarding unpaid debts except when the debt has been reduced to judgment.   
 
The underwriter should document the reason(s) for not considering an account 
on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
Judgments 
 
Account balances reduced to judgment by a court must either be paid in full or 
subject to a repayment plan with a history of timely payments.   
 
A history of timely payments would be generally considered as making 12 
payments to reestablish credit.   
 
However, in certain cases when a judgment has only been in place for a few 
months, an underwriter could justify on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, a 
shorter repayment history if the documentation indicates the borrower 
immediately addressed the judgment after it was filed and began a repayment 
plan. 
 
Payoff of Unpaid or Untimely Debts 
 
For unpaid or debts that have not been paid timely, pay-off of these debts after 
the acceptability of a borrower's credit is questioned does not alter the 
unsatisfactory record of payment.  A period of making timely payments on 
subsequent obligations for at least 12 months, then satisfactory credit is 
considered re-established.

b. How to  Consumer Credit Counseling Plan 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  If a borrower(s) has prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer 
Credit Counseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk 
if they demonstrate 12 months’ satisfactory payments and the counseling 
agency approves the new credit. If a borrower(s) has good prior credit and are 
participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, such participation is to be 
considered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in determining 
creditworthiness.  Do not treat this as a negative credit item if the borrower 
entered the Consumer Credit Counseling plan before reaching the point of 
having bad credit. 
 
Bankruptcy 
 
The fact that a bankruptcy exists in a borrower (or spouse’s) credit history 
does not in itself disqualify the loan.  Develop complete information on the 
facts and circumstances of the bankruptcy.  Consider the reasons for the 
bankruptcy and the type of bankruptcy filing. 
 
Bankruptcy Filed Under the Straight Liquidation and Discharge 
Provisions of the Bankruptcy Law (Petition under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code): 
 
•  If the bankruptcy was discharged more than 2 years ago from the date 
of closing for purchases and refinances, it may be disregarded.   
•  If the bankruptcy was discharged within the last 1 to 2 years, it is 
probably not possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are 
met: 
 
Requirement  Explanation 
1  The borrower(s) had obtained consumer items on credit 
subsequent to the bankruptcy and has satisfactorily made 
the payments over a continued period. 
2  The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the 
control of the borrower or spouse such as unemployment, 
prolonged strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance, 
and so on, and the circumstances are verified.  Divorce is 
not generally viewed as beyond the control of the 
borrower and/or spouse.

continued   
If the bankruptcy was caused by failure of the business of a self-employed borrower, 
it may be possible to determine that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk if all 
four of the following are met: 
 
Requirement  Explanation 
1  The borrower obtained a permanent position after the 
business failed. 
2  There is not any derogatory credit information prior to the 
self-employment. 
3  There is not any derogatory credit information subsequent to 
the bankruptcy. 
4  Failure of the business was not due to the borrower’s 
misconduct. 
 
Bankruptcy Petition Under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code 
This type of filing indicates an effort to pay creditors.  Regular payments are made 
to a court-appointed trustee over a 2 to 3-year period or, in some cases, up to 5 
years, to pay off scaled down or entire debts. 
 
If the borrower(s) has finished making all payments satisfactorily, the lender may 
conclude that the borrower has re-established satisfactory credit. 
 
If the borrowers) has satisfactorily made at least 12 months’ worth of the payments 
and the Trustee or the Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit, the lender may 
give favorable consideration.

b. How to  Foreclosures 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  The fact that a home loan foreclosure (or deed-in-lieu or short sale in lieu of 
foreclosure) exists in a borrower(s) history does not in itself disqualify the loan.  
Develop complete information on the facts and circumstances of the 
foreclosure. 
 
You may disregard a foreclosure finalized more than 2 years from the date of 
closing. If the foreclosure was finalized within the last 1 to 2 years from the 
date of closing, it is probably not possible to determine that the borrower(s) is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are met: 
 
The borrower (s) has obtained consumer items on credit subsequent to the 
foreclosure and has satisfactorily made the payments over a continued period, 
and 
 
The foreclosure was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
borrower (s) such as unemployment; prolonged strikes, medical bills not 
covered by insurance, and so on, and the circumstances are verified.   
 
If a foreclosure, deed in lieu, or short sale process is in conjunction with a 
bankruptcy, use the latest date of either the discharge of the bankruptcy or 
transfer of title for the home to establish the beginning date of re-established 
credit.  If there is a significant delay in the transfer of title, the lender should 
contact the RLC of jurisdiction for guidance. 
 
Deed in lieu or short sale 
 
For a deed in lieu or short sale, develop complete information on the facts and 
circumstances in which the borrowers) voluntarily surrendered the property.  If 
the borrower’s payment history on the property was not affected before the 
short sale or deed in lieu and was voluntarily communicating with the servicer 
or holder, then a waiting period from the date transfer of the property may not 
be necessary. 
 
If the foreclosure, deed and lieu or short sale was on a VA-guaranteed loan, 
then a borrower may not have full entitlement available for the new VA loan.  
Ensure that the borrower’s COE reflects sufficient entitlement to meet any 
secondary marketing requirements of the lender.

VA has approved Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, Fannie Mae’s Desktop 
a. General AUS 
Underwriter, and VA approved proprietary lender AUS systems to use in 
Information 
connection with VA-guaranteed home loans.  These systems incorporate VA’s 
credit standards and processing requirements. 
 
Lenders may use certain reduced documentation requirements on cases 
processed with approved AUS.  The level of reduced documentation depends 
on the risk classification assigned.  The systems use different terminology such 
as Approve or Accept.  The tables in this section give a general description of 
documentation waivers.  Please note that the documentation requirements are 
the same for these cases as for non-AUS cases, except for any differences cited 
in the tables. 
 
The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely 
determine a risk classification.  It is still the lenders underwriter’s decision 
whether or not to approve the loan.   
 
Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor.  
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these systems. 
 
It is imperative that the data entered into the automated underwriting system 
be accurately verified.  The data utilized by the system must be supported by 
source documentation obtained by the lender.  Inaccurate or unverified data 
will result in invalidation of the risk classification.  Under certain 
circumstances, it could also result in a finding of material misrepresentation, 
which could affect the validity of the guaranty.   
 
b.  Because the AUS will be making the determination that the loan satisfies 
Underwriter’s  credit and income requirements, cases receiving an “Accept” or “Approve” 
Certification  rating will not require the underwriter’s signature on VA Form 26-6393, Loan 
Analysis (items 49 through 53).  However, the file must still contain the 
Lender’s Certification referenced in Chapter 5 of the VA Lender’s Handbook.

a. General 
In order to properly enter information on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, 
the underwriter must understand and apply the guidelines provided in the 
preceding sections of this chapter.  
 
b. Estimated  Special instructions are listed in the following table: 
Monthly   
Shelter  Item  Special Instructions 
Expenses 
16  If taxes are expected to increase, use the increased amount. 
17  Include the flood insurance premium for properties located in 
special flood hazard areas. 
18  If special assessments are anticipated, use the anticipated 
amount. 
19  Calculate maintenance and utility costs using 14¢ per square 
foot for the gross living area as per the appraisal. 
 
Example:  A 1,500 square foot home with a 1,500 square foot 
unfished basement would have a combined maintenance and 
utility cost of $210 (1,500sq X .14). 
20  For condominiums or houses in a Planned Unit Development 
(PUD), include the monthly amount of maintenance 
assessment payable to the homeowner’s association.   
 
 
c. Debts and  List all known debts and obligations of the borrower and spouse including any 
Obligations  alimony and/or child support payments.  Spousal support or alimony may be 
treated as a reduction in income; however, child support is to be treated as a 
liability. 
 
Place a check mark in the (3) column next to any “significant” debt or 
obligation.  See the topic “Analysis of Debts and Obligations” in Topic 4.05c 
of this chapter, for an explanation of “significant.” 
 
Job Related Expense – Section D line 29. 
 
Include any costs for child care, significant commuting costs, and any other 
direct or incidental costs associated with the borrower’s (or spouse’s) 
employment.  Check this item if total job-related expenses are significant.

e. Balance  Examples 
Available for   
Family  A Veteran has a family size of 3 purchasing a home in Arizona with a loan 
Support-      
amount of $400,000.  The residual figure will be $990. 
Item 43, 
 
continued 
A Veteran has a family size of 8 purchasing a home in Georgia with a loan 
amount of $150,000.  The residual figure will be $1,199 (family size of 5 
which is $1,039 adding $80 for each additional family member up to a family 
size of 7).  The eighth person will not be considered in the calculation. 
 
Special Instructions   
 
Count all members of the household (without regard to the nature of the 
relationship) when determining “family size,” including: 
 
•  A borrower’s spouse who is not joining in title or on the note, and 
•  Any other individuals who depend on the borrower for support.  
 
If a dependent is claimed on the Federal Tax Returns, then the dependent must 
be considered as a member of the household, to calculate residual income. 
 
Examples 
 
•  Children from a spouse’s prior marriage who are not the borrower’s 
legal dependents. 
•  A dependent parent.  
 
Exceptions for Considering All Members of the Household 
 
The lender may omit any individuals from “family size” who are fully 
supported from a source of verified income which, for whatever reason, is not 
included in effective income in the loan analysis.   
 
Examples 
 
•  a spouse not obligated on the title or on the note that has stable and 
reliable income sufficient to support his or her living expenses. 
•  a child for whom sufficient foster care payments or child support is 
received regularly, or 
•  a parent who has sufficient stable and reliable non-taxable income.

Item 43,

from use of military-based facilities located near the property.  Examples 
include Guard and Reserve military retirees, 100 percent disabled Veterans 
and their family members, or Medal of Honor recipients. 
 
f. Debt-to- VA’s debt-to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
Income Ratio,  expense, installment debts, and other debt) to gross monthly income.  The 
Item 44  following steps are required to determine the debt-to-income ratio: 
 
Step  Description 
1  Add: Items 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 +20 +40 = Debt 
2  Add:  Items 31 + 38* = Income 
3  Divide:  Debt * Income = Debt-to-Income Ratio 
4  Round:  To the nearest two digits 
 
The “Debt-to-Income Ratio” heading in Topic 10, subsection b of this chapter 
contains special procedures to apply if the ratio exceeds 41 percent. 
 
Only the borrower's actual income may be used to calculate the residual 
income.   
 
Care should be exercised to ensure that the income considered tax-exempt is 
likely to continue and remain untaxed.   
 
Tax-free income includes certain military allowances, child support payments, 
workers’ compensation benefits, disability retirement payments, and certain 
types of public assistance payments.   
                                                                                  Continued on next page

Income Ratio,   
Item 44,  Tax-free income may be “grossed up” for purposes of calculating the debt-to-
continued 
income ratio only. 
 
•  This is a tool that may be used to lower the debt ratio for borrowers 
who clearly qualify for the loan.   
•  “Grossing up” involves adjusting the income upward to a pre-tax or 
gross income amount which, after deducting state and Federal income 
taxes, equals the tax-exempt income.   
•  Use current IRS and state income tax withholding tables to determine 
an amount which can be prudently employed to adjust the borrower’s 
actual income. Use a figure of 125 percent of the borrower’s non-
taxable income when “grossing up.” 
•  Do not add non-taxable income to taxable income before “grossing 
up.” 
•  If “grossing up” is used, indicate such and provide the “grossed up” 
ratio of 125 percent in item 47, “Remarks.” The actual amounts of the 
borrower’s non-taxable income should not be adjusted in in line 38. 
 
g. Past Credit  Indicate whether the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) is a satisfactory or 
Record-       unsatisfactory credit risk based on a complete analysis of credit data.

Income 
Instead, consider residual income in conjunction with all other credit factors. 
 
However, an inadequate residual income alone can be a basis for disapproving 
a loan.   
 
If residual income is marginal, look to other indicators such as the borrower’s 
credit history, and in particular, whether and how the borrower has previously 
handled similar housing expense. 
 
Consider the ages of the borrower’s dependents in determining the adequacy 
of residual income. 
 
b. Debt-to  VA’s debt-to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
Income Ratio  expense, installment debts, and other obligations listed in section D of VA 
Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, to gross monthly income.  It is a guide and, as 
an underwriting factor, it is secondary to the residual income.  It should not 
automatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan.  Instead, consider the 
ratio in conjunction with all other credit factors. 
 
A ratio greater than 41 percent requires close scrutiny unless: 
 
•  the ratio is greater than 41 percent unless it is larger due solely to the 
existence of tax-free income which should be noted in the loan file), 
the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's 
supervisor, or 
•  residual income exceeds the guideline by at least 20 percent. 
 
Loans closed automatically with a debt-to-income ratio greater than 41 
percent: 
 
•  Include a statement justifying the reasons for approval, signed by the 
underwriter’s supervisor, unless residual income exceeds the guideline 
by at least 20 percent. 
•  The statement must include the reason(s) for approving the loan and 
list the compensating factors justifying approval of the loan.

Compensating  especially important when reviewing loans which are marginal with respect to 
Factors  residual income or debt-to-income ratio.  They cannot be used to compensate 
for unsatisfactory credit.   
 
Valid compensating factors should represent strengths rather than mere 
satisfaction of basic program requirements.  For example, the fact that a 
borrower has sufficient assets for closing purposes, or meets the residual 
income guideline, is not a compensating factor. 
 
Valid compensating factors should logically be able to compensate (to some 
extent) for the identified weakness in the loan.  For example, significant liquid 
assets may compensate for a residual income shortfall whereas long-term 
employment would not. 
 
Compensating factors include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
• excellent credit history, 
• conservative use of consumer credit, 
• minimal consumer debt, 
• long-term employment, 
• significant liquid assets, 
• sizable downpayment, 
• the existence of equity in refinancing loans, 
• little or no increase in shelter expense, 
• military benefits, 
• satisfactory homeownership experience, 
• high residual income, 
• low debt-to-income ratio, 
• tax credits for child care, and  
• tax benefits of home ownership

• ability of the borrower to accumulate liquid assets, and

If a borrower’s application shows little or no reserves and excessive 
obligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in 
shelter expenses can be absorbed.  
 
f. Home  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, many 
Mortgage  lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate 
Disclosure Act  measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to home 
(HMDA) 
mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be aware of 
how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in meeting this 
goal. 
 
Compatibility of VA Program with HMDA 
 
The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for 
individuals with low-to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such borrowers.  VA Credit Standards are written as guidelines and are 
meant to be interpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration all of 
an individual loan borrower’s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.   
 
Purpose of HMDA 
 
VA encourages underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which 
ought to be approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of 
the credit standards.   
 
Underwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications for 
every qualified Veteran.

Completion  in any feasible order, with the exception of the Certificate of Eligibility 
(COE), as long as they are all completed prior to loan closing.  The COE must 
be obtained prior to ordering an appraisal.  These procedures apply to both 
prior approval loans and loans closed automatically (except the procedure 
which specifically refers to prior approval loans). 
 
To avoid delays in closing, it is recommended that the lender take the 
following actions in the very early stages of loan processing: 
 
  obtain a COE (see subsection b of this chapter), 
  request an appraisal assignment in VA’s web-based loan guaranty 
system (WebLGY), (see Chapter 10 of this handbook for the steps to 
order an appraisal), 
  initiate the Credit Alert Verification Report System (CAIVRS) and, if 
applicable, a complete VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA Benefits, 
(see Topic 6, Chapter 4 of the Lender’s Handbook), 
  request a credit report and verifications (see Topic 7, Chapter 4 of this 
handbook).

most efficient processing times.  Veterans may also apply online through 
eBenefits. A COE obtained by the borrower in eBenefits will be in WebLGY.  
This COE can be accessed by the lender using at least two of the requested 
data points in the system, for example the reference number and Veteran’s 
social security number.  An additional or updated COE does not need to be 
obtained or updated unless a change needs to be made to the COE.  Please 
examine and understand the conditions of the COE. Failure to comply with 
the COE conditions may result in an ineligible loan (see Chapter 2 of this

Ensure the Veteran, eligible as an active duty member, is still on active duty 
at the time of closing if the COE indicates: “Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of continuous 
active duty as of the date of note is required.”  If the lender becomes aware 
that the applicant is no longer on active duty, the loan may not be closed 
unless VA re-establishes the Veteran’s eligibility as follows: 
 
  A Veteran released from active duty must have a DD214 Form 
(member copy 4) with time served, Character of Service Discharge, 
and reason for the discharge listed. It must be uploaded into 
WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
  A Veteran released from the National Guard or Reserves must have 
evidence of time served and an Honorable discharge. This must be 
uploaded into WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
  If a COE was issued based upon active duty service and the Veteran 
has been separated, eligibility must be re-determined based upon 
their length of service and character of service.

a.  Loans to be  Lenders without automatic authority are strongly encouraged to enter into a 
Submitted for  sponsor/agent relationship with a VA-approved automatic lender to expedite 
Prior Approval  VA loan processing and underwriting.  If a lender does not have a sponsor, 
then they must submit an application to VA for prior approval lending.  Those 
without sponsors or automatic authority must upload all loans into WebLGY 
for prior approval, except IRRRLs made to refinance loans that are not 
delinquent (see Chapter 1 of this handbook).  
 
Lenders must upload all prior approval documents into WebLGY, for RLC 
review (see Subsection c of this Topic).  A user’s guide for uploading prior 
approval loans is available online at 
http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/documents/docs/prior_approval_LP_le
nders.pdf. 
 
All lenders, whether or not they have automatic authority, must submit the 
following types of loans to VA for prior approval: 
 
  joint loans, except Veteran-Veteran as a married couple (see Chapter 7 
of this handbook) 
  loans to Veteran in receipt of VA nonservice-connected pension.  This 
is not the same as VA disability – income based (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
  loans to Veterans who have a VA Fiduciary (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
  IRRRLs made to refinance delinquent loans (See Chapter 6 of this 
handbook) 
  manufactured home loans (home is not titled as real-estate) 
  supplemental loans 
 
Note:  COEs may indicate to submit VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA 
Benefits.  The form is completed by the VA RLC of jurisdiction where the 
property is located, and will indicate whether the Veteran receives VA non-
service connected pension or has a VA Fiduciary.  For a list of all VA offices 
and their jurisdictions visit

VA cannot address overlays established by a company or investor and the loan 
should not be submitted as a prior approval for the lender to overcome any 
 
company or investor requirements. 
 
 
The lender must furnish a cover letter with the uploaded file that states the 
  reason(s) for the prior approval submission and explains any unique 
circumstances.  In addition, the cover letter must include the submitting

Processing of a   
Prior Approval    suspend processing and request additional information from the lender. 
Application    send a notice of denial to the lender and borrower, or  
  issue VA’s certificate of commitment to the lender, which is evidence 
 
of VA’s approval of the loan to close and willingness to guaranty the 
loan. 
 
Loans submitted on the prior approval basis have a 10-business day timeliness 
requirement by VA. 
The processing time may be extended for loans involving the receipt of VA 
pension income or a Veteran with a VA Fiduciary. Either the VA Pension or 
Fiduciary HUB may have, in addition to Loan Guaranty, to provide a review 
of the loan file. 
   
VA‘s certificate of commitment must be obtained prior to closing and is the

Commitment  lender’s evidence of VA’s willingness to guaranty the loan.  The lender is 
subsequently entitled to evidence of guaranty if the: 
   
  the closed loan is identical in all respects to that submitted to VA on 
the URLA and described on the certificate of commitment (or, if not 
identical, any required VA approval of changes was obtained prior to 
closing), and 
  the lender has complied with all applicable provisions of the law and 
loan guaranty regulations in making the loan.  Additionally, all 
conditions of the certificate of commitment must be met. 
 
If, at any time prior to closing, the lender or VA has reason to doubt the 
continued qualification of the loan, the lender will delay closing until all facts 
are determined and reviewed again by VA. 
 
VA may cancel a commitment if the validity period of the certificate of 
commitment has expired (after 180 days), and there is no reasonable 
expectation that the loan will be reported for guaranty.   
 
A commitment may be extended under certain circumstances.  Contact the 
VA office of jurisdiction of where the property is located for a review of the 
prior approval commitment.

Change Date  April 1, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  General  If you are not the loan servicer or holder of the current VA loan, please refer 
Information  the borrower or purchaser to the servicer or holder of the current VA loan for 
processing.  Assumptions can only be processed and closed by loan holders 
and services with VA automatic authority that are holding or servicing the 
current VA loan.   
 
Loan holders or servicers holding the loan without VA automatic authority 
that are holding or servicing the current VA loan, may submit a prior approval 
package to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located. See 
Topic 1 of this chapter.  
 
A VA assumption is also considered a Release of Liability (ROL).  
 
Properties that are security for VA-guaranteed loans may be disposed or 
transferred even though the loans are not paid in full. Veterans who dispose or 
transfer their properties under these conditions remain liable to VA for any 
loss that may occur as a result of a future default and subsequent claim 
payment, unless the property is transferred to a creditworthy purchaser who 
agrees to assume the payment obligation.  The servicer initially determines the 
purchaser’s creditworthiness.

a. General  Any purchaser may qualify to assume a VA loan; however, for a Veteran’s 
Information,  entitlement to be restored, a Veteran purchaser with sufficient entitlement 
continued  must complete a Substitution of Entitlement (SOE) when the ROL is closed.  
The Veteran’s entitlement is not restored unless the Veteran purchaser, in 
addition to assuming the payment obligation, also agrees and is eligible to 
substitute their entitlement for the Veteran seller’s entitlement. It is important 
for the servicer as soon as possible in the assumption process to obtain COEs 
for both the Veteran assumer and Veteran seller to determine if there is 
sufficient entitlement in which to substitute. See chapter 3 of this handbook. 
 
Unless the ROL is an unrestricted transfer, a closing disclosure is required.  
 
An ROL or SOE does not affect the original issuance of the LGC. 
 
 
b.  Who Can  While procedures for processing requests for assumption approvals previously 
Process Loan  depended on the date of loan (commitment made on or after March 1, 1988), 
Assumptions?    the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) regulations authorize 
loan holders or servicers with automatic authority that are holding or servicing 
the current VA loan to be transferred to determine creditworthiness on all 
assumption approval requests processed by their servicers. 
 
c.  Servicers  Servicers with automatic authority are authorized to process and determine 
with Automatic  creditworthiness on assumption approval requests on behalf of VA.  Servicers 
Authority  must follow VA underwriting guidelines (see chapter 4 of this handbook) 
when processing and determining creditworthiness on these cases. 
   
Servicers must notify VA electronically of authorized ownership transfers and 
approved ROLs in VALERI.  Additional information on the reporting process 
is available online at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/valeri.asp. 
 
An underwriting and closing package must be uploaded into WebLGY, for the 
existing VA loan number.

When neither the servicer nor the holder has automatic authority, the servicer 
must develop a complete credit package and submit it, along with a copy of 
the purchase contract and the status of the loan to the Loan Production 
section at the VA RLC where the property is located.    
 
The package should contain a cover letter indicating prior approval 
underwriting is required as both the servicer and the holder do not have VA 
automatic authority. 
 
See Topic 4, subsection c, of this chapter for the stacking order.

A seller must apply for approval of the transfer prior to completing the sale.   
 
Servicers and holders with automatic authority must examine the application 
to assess compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714.  VA will make 
the determination in a case where neither the servicer nor the holder has 
automatic authority, following receipt of a complete application package from 
the servicer or holder.

f.  Approval  To approve the transfer of ownership: 
Requirements   
  the loan must be current or will be brought current at the closing of 
the sales transaction, 
  the prospective purchaser of the property is creditworthy, as 
determined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and Chapter 4 of 
the Lender’s Handbook, and 
  the prospective purchaser has agreed to assume all of the loan 
obligations, including the obligation to indemnify VA if a claim is 
paid. 
 
A processing fee may be collected in advance, including a reasonable 
estimate for the cost of the credit report.  The maximum fee for processing a 
request for assumption approval and changing the loan records is the lesser 
of: 
 
  automatic authority – $300 plus the actual cost of a credit report; or 
  no automatic authority – $250 plus the actual cost of a credit report; 
or 
  any maximum prescribed by applicable state law. 
 
VA does not specifically regulate when the processing fee may be assessed.  
However, when the processing fee is collected prior to signing the sales 
contract, the portion of the fee attributable to changing the servicer’s records 
(usually $50) must be returned to the seller if the application is denied or the 
process is not completed.  Therefore, VA recommends that the processing 
charge accompany the complete package.

When the VA RLC receives an appeal of a denied request, VA will request 
that the servicer send a copy of the application package used in making the 
decision.   
 
The loan package must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction of where 
the property is located within 7 calendar days.  
 
The VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located will review and

i.  VA Appeals,  VA’s special approval does not release any obligor from liability. VA may 
continued   determine that special approval of the assumption is in the best interest of the 
government if: 
 
  the seller agrees to remain secondarily liable on the loan following 
assumption, 
  the seller is unable to otherwise continue payments on the loan, and 
reasonable efforts have been made to find a creditworthy borrower 
for the property, or 
  if an obligor is released without proper approval, VA may be released 
from further liability on the guaranty. 
 
VA has 7 calendar days from receipt of the seller’s request to make this 
determination.   
 
If approved, the VA RLC will notify the servicer and seller that the 
assumption has been approved and that the seller will not be released from 
liability to VA; however, the property can be transferred to the purchaser(s). 
The servicer should close the assumption with 30 days of VA’s special 
approval. 
 
If disapproved, the VA RLC will notify the seller and lender that the 
assumption has not been approved, that the seller will not be released 
from liability, and the property cannot be transferred. 
 
j.  Steps After  Once approved, the servicer will complete the transfer with a loan 
Approval  closing that meets all federal and any state and local regulations and 
requirements.

k. Assumption  The VA-approved assumption clause must be included in the deed 
Clause  conveying the property to the purchaser.  The VA RLC of jurisdiction 
of where the property is located has an example(s) of assumption 
clauses that are both acceptable to VA and compliant with state and 
local requirements.  
 
Servicers should contact the RLC of jurisdiction of where the property 
is located to obtain sample language and/or documents.  
 
The servicer is responsible for reviewing the document to establish that 
it contains the approved assumption clause and recording data and that 
it has the legal effect intended. 
 
 
l.  Agreement  If the seller and purchaser have satisfied all the requirements of 38 
Creating  U.S.C. 3714(a)(1), but the transfer deed containing an acceptable 
Liability  assumption clause was not included, the servicer must prepare an 
“Agreement Creating Liability to Holder and to United States” to 
execute the release. 
 
The servicer must prepare an Agreement Creating Liability to Holder 
and to “United States” to execute the release.  
 
Three copies are needed for execution and must be signed by the: 
 
  seller, 
  purchaser, and 
  servicer as agent for the Department of Veteran Affairs.

Once received, the servicer is responsible for reviewing the document to 
establish that it was properly completed and that it has the legal effect

The holder or its authorized servicing agent will then execute the release 
portion of the form.  
 
In those states where recording the assumption and/or the release 
instrument is necessary, the Veteran may be asked to pay the recording 
fees. 
 
m.  Funding  At loan transfer, the purchaser is required to pay a funding fee to the 
Fee    servicer equal to one-half of one percent of the loan balance as of the date 
of transfer. 
 
See Chapter 8 of this handbook for information on other exemptions from 
the funding fee and how to verify exemption status. 
 
When the transfer is a result of an unrestricted transfer, a funding fee is 
not required.   
 
The fee must be paid to VA within 15 calendar days of the date of 
assumption using the VA Funding Fee Payment System – VA FFPS . 
 
The VA funding fee cannot be financed into the loan being assumed.  It 
must be paid in cash at the time of transfer. 
 
n.  Notification  Servicers must notify VA after ownership has been transferred and release

Servicers are required to retain the supporting documentation for all 
transfers, assumptions, and an ROL for at least 3 years from approval or 
denial.  
 
o.  Assumptions  Servicers must notify VA’s Loan Production Department at the RLC of 
without Prior  jurisdiction of where the property is located (in addition to the VALERI 
Approval  system) within 60 days after learning of a transfer that did not receive prior 
approval by the servicer or VA.  
 
The notice must advise VA whether the servicer intends to exercise the 
option to immediately refer the case to foreclosure or to give the transferor 
and transferee the opportunity to apply for “retroactive approval” of the 
assumption. 
 
Upon learning of an unapproved transfer, the servicer may decide to demand 
immediate payment of the one-half of one percent VA funding fee and 
request a copy of the instrument of transfer to determine the liability of the 
purchaser. 
 
Loans for which a commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988, are 
commonly known as freely assumable loans.  Owners have the right to sell 
the property securing these loans under any terms; servicers may not impose 
a restriction, charge, or fee that would limit or nullify this right.  A funding 
fee is not assessed on assumptions of loans where the commitment was made 
prior to March 1, 1988.

o.  Assumptions  Liability assumed.  The purchaser should be afforded an opportunity for 
without Prior  retroactive approval of the transfer if: 
Approval,   
continued 
  the purchaser pays the funding fee, 
  the purchaser has assumed all of the seller’s obligations in the 
transfer deed, 
  the assumption language is legally binding, and  
  it appears that the purchaser intends to satisfy those obligations. 
 
When these conditions have been met, then the Veteran and transferee 
must specifically apply for an ROL under 38 U.S.C. 3713.  See 
subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the original Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect the guaranty on the loan. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for a 
Substitution of Entitlement to restore the Veteran seller’s entitlement 
(see subsection r of this topic). 
 
 Liability not assumed.  If prior approval of a transfer was not 
obtained and the title was transferred “subject to” the mortgage or 
deed of trust, then the purchaser usually has no liability on the loan 
and no liability for the funding fee. In this instance, the purchaser 
may have no incentive to maintain the payments.

continued  
 
It may still be advisable to extend the opportunity to apply for 
retroactive approval of the transfer, with the expectation that the 
purchaser will assume liability for repayment of the loan. 
 
The original mortgagor remains liable on the loan unless he or she is 
released from personal liability with a qualifying assumption.  The 
Veteran and transferee must specifically apply for an ROL under 38 
U.S.C. 3713.  See subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the original Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect the guaranty on the loan. The LGC 
remains in the original Veteran’s name. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for an 
SOE to restore the Veteran seller’s entitlement. See subsection r of 
this topic. 
 
An exception applies when the loan was made by a state, territorial, 
or local governmental agency and the law requires acceleration of the 
maturity of the loan upon sale or transfer of the property to a person 
not eligible for assistance under the special program.  VA has 
approved due-on-sale clauses to allow Veterans to participate in these 
programs and take advantage of below-market interest rates and 
benefits.

Should a purchaser fail to cooperate in the retroactive approval 
process, a servicer has the option of accelerating the loan.   
 
When making this decision, the servicer should consider the 
implications of state law when delaying acceleration as compared to 
the prospect of accelerating a current loan that has the potential for 
future timely payments. 
 
Any decision must be reported to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of the

Liability   
Procedures for 
  the divorce is final and absolute and it is determined no 
Divorce, 
appeal will be taken, or 
continued 
  a signed separation agreement by all parties based on 
local laws and available documents with reasons why a 
separation agreement is used in lieu of a final decree of 
divorce, and  
  the entire estate encumbered for the VA-guaranteed 
loan has become vested in the name of the Veteran’s 
former  spouse, and 
  there is not any knowledge of any property settlement 
that would make the Veteran liable between the parties 
to pay the guaranteed loan. 
 
Some states require a specific amount of time between a legal 
separation and a divorce (up to one year).  With proper 
documentation, do not delay the request for an ROL, if the divorce is 
not final, but a legal separation agreement is in effect. 
 
In some instances, the ex-spouse may also be a Veteran; however, for 
VA purposes, only the applicant who used their entitlement to 
guaranty the loan is considered a Veteran.   
 
For example, John and Mary Doe are divorcing and both have 
obtained a COE; however, only John’s COE was used to guarantee 
the loan.  Since Mary’s COE was not used to guarantee the home, 
only John is considered the Veteran.  If Mary wishes to assume the 
loan, a credit qualifying package is required for an ROL and Mary 
can substitute her entitlement with the assumption. 
 
When the Veteran is awarded the property, the ex-spouse may seek an 
ROL.

The servicer will be provided a with an NVS letter indicating VA has 
released the non-Veteran spouse of liability. 
 
The servicer may only charge a fee of $50 for amending its records to 
reflect the change. 
 
 It is not necessary for the servicer to complete an ROL. 
 
For example, Mary and Jon Smith divorced after they purchased a 
home using Mary’s COE.  She obtains the home per the divorce 
decree.  Since she is the Veteran and will be retaining the property, 
she will contact the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is 
located to process the NVS. 
   
r.  Substitution  A Veteran may allow an assumption/ROL of his or her VA-
of Entitlement  guaranteed loan with the expectation of being able to have his or her 
entitlement restored.  A restoration may be needed to obtain another 
VA-guaranteed loan in the future by restoring the previously used 
entitlement for full entitlement benefits.  Entitlement cannot be 
restored until VA makes a determination of eligibility for the Veteran 
assumer and Veteran seller and processes the SOE.  VA completes the 
SOE process after a servicer closes the assumption and issues an 
ROL.  Questions about an SOE should be directed to the VA RLC 
with jurisdiction where the property is located. 
 
It is important for the servicer to obtain a COE as soon as possible in 
the assumption process to determine if there is sufficient entitlement 
for the Veteran assumer to complete the SOE for the Veteran seller.  
Entitlement must be of equal amounts to substitute.  See Chapter 3 of 
this handbook for determination of home loan eligibility.

r.  Substitution  When a Veteran requests approval for a transfer of ownership, he or 
of Entitlement,  she may request to have entitlement restored for use on another VA 
continued   loan. For VA to approve such a request: 
 
  the assumption (ROL) must be completed and closed by the lender; 
  the purchaser must be an eligible Veteran who has sufficient 
entitlement to substitute for that of the original Veteran; 
  the purchaser must certify that the property securing the loan will be 
occupied as his or her residence; 
  the purchasing Veteran must agree to the SOE; and 
  there must be equal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran 
in order to substitute his or her entitlement with the Veteran being 
released of their entitlement. 
 
The assumption (ROL) must be completed and closed by the lender. 
 
The purchaser must be an eligible Veteran who has sufficient 
entitlement to substitute for that of the original Veteran. 
 
The purchaser must certify that the property securing the loan will be 
occupied as his or her residence. 
 
The purchasing Veteran must agree to the SOE, and there must be 
equal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran in order to 
substitute his or her entitlement with the Veteran being released of 
their entitlement. 
 
Whenever two Veterans intend to follow the SOE process, the 
servicer should have the Veteran purchaser complete VA Form 26-
8106, Statement of Veteran Assuming GI Loan, (Substitution of 
entitlement).  It should be included in the closing package submitted 
to VA. 
 
A COE for each Veteran should accompany the credit package used 
to approve the ROL. 
 
It is important to verify the purchasing Veteran has sufficient 
entitlement, is willing to substitute their entitlement, and will meet 
occupancy requirements to substitute before the closing of the ROL to 
meet the requirements of an SOE.

It is permissible to charge a reasonable fee up to $50 for changing the

Servicers must report unrestricted transfers to VA through VALERI 
as authorized transfers of ownership, which will typically be handled 
automatically by their servicing systems.   
 
Unrestricted transfers of ownership include: 
 
  the creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the 
lender’s security instrument that does not relate to a transfer of 
rights of occupancy in the property; 
  the creation of a purchase money security interest for 
household appliances; 
  a transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death 
of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety; 
  the granting of a leasehold interest of 3 years or less not 
containing an option to purchase; 
  a transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;  
  a transfer when the spouse or child of the borrower becomes a 
joint owner of the property with the borrower,  
  a transfer into an inter-vivos trust in which the borrower is and 
remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer 
of rights of occupancy in the property; and 
  a transfer resulting from a decree to dissolve a marriage, legal 
separation agreement, or from an incidental property 
settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower 
becomes the sole owner of the property.

are not subject to 38 U.S.C. 3714. 
 
These sale agreements do not require prior approval from the servicer 
or VA. 
 
 
Borrowers inquiring should be cautioned that any borrower 
considering a sale in this manner would remain liable for repayment of 
the loan under such an arrangement.

Depending on the circumstances of a case, servicers may agree to 
change the account address to read “in care of” the contract purchaser, 
although the contract seller must promptly advise the servicer of any 
change in his or her address. 
 
Sales by installment contracts typically call for transfer of title after a 
certain period of time. 
 
If the contract calls for title to transfer prior to payment in full of the 
VA loan, VA requires assumption approval according to the 
procedures previously discussed. 
 
Processing charges and VA funding fees will be applicable upon 
transfer. 
 
As one of the conditions of the contract, servicers should advise the 
borrower that the language stating an application for assumption 
approval will be made, and approval secured, prior to the completion 
of title transfer. 
 
The contract should address the options of both parties if the request 
for assumption approval is denied. 
 
Servicers are required to retain the supporting documentation for all 
transfers, assumptions, and releases of liability for at least 3 years 
from approval or denial.  
 
An assumption package should be submitted to the RLC of 
jurisdiction of where the property is located.

 This section has been changed to update hyperlinks and to make minor 
grammatical edits. 
  
a. What is an  An IRRRL is a VA-guaranteed loan made to refinance an existing VA-
IRRRL?  guaranteed loan, generally at a lower interest rate than the existing VA loan, 
and with lower principal and interest payments than the existing VA loan.    
 
Generally, no appraisal, credit information or underwriting is required on an 
IRRRL, and any lender may close an IRRRL automatically.   
 
Note: Exceptions and specific requirements are explained in the remainder of 
this section. 
  
b. Interest Rate  An IRRRL (which can be a fixed rate, hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage 
Decrease  (ARM) or traditional ARM) must bear a lower interest rate than the loan it is 
Requirement  refinancing unless the loan it is refinancing is an ARM. 
 
c. Payment  The principal and interest payment on an IRRRL must be less than the

Increase  following exceptions applies: 
Requirements 
 
 the IRRRL is refinancing an ARM, 
 term of the IRRRL is shorter than the term of the loan being refinanced, or 
 energy efficiency improvements are included in the IRRRL. 
 
A significant increase in the veteran’s monthly payment may occur with any 
of these three exceptions, especially if combined with one or more of the 
following: 
 
 financing of closing costs, 
 financing of up to two discount points,  
 financing of the funding fee, and/or 
 higher interest rate when an ARM is being refinanced.

Decrease/  must: 
Increase   
Requirements 
 determine that the veteran qualifies for the new payment from an 
(continued) 
underwriting standpoint; such as, determine whether the borrower can 
support the proposed shelter expense and other recurring monthly 
obligations in light of income established as stable and reliable, and  
 include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceeds the previous payment by 20 percent or more. 
 
d. Veteran’s  For all IRRRLs, the veteran must sign a statement acknowledging the effect 
Statement and  of the refinancing loan on the veteran’s loan payments and interest rate.  
Lender’s   
Certification 
The statement must show the interest rate and monthly payments for the new 
loan versus that for the old loan.  The statement must also indicate how long it 
would take to recoup ALL closing costs (both those included in the loan and 
those paid outside of closing).   
 
If the monthly payment (PITI) increases by 20 percent or more, the lender 
must include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceeds the previous payment by 20 percent or more. 
 
Example:   
 
 Vet’s monthly payment decreases by $50.00. 
 Vet pays $5,000 in closing costs (includes all costs – closing costs, funding 
fee, discounts, etc). 
 Recoup closing costs in 100 months - $5,000 divided by $50.  
 
Note:  This would not be required in those limited cases where the payment is 
not decreasing (reduced term of loan, etc.). 
 
The veteran’s statement may be combined with the lender’s certification and 
should be on the lender’s own letterhead.  For a sample please go to:

e. What Closing  The following fees and charges may be included in an IRRRL: 
Costs can be   
Included in the   the VA funding fee, and 
Loan? 
 any allowable fees and charges discussed in section 2 of chapter 8; such as, 
all allowable closing costs, including the lender’s flat charge. 
 
However, There Is One Limitation 
While the borrower may pay any reasonable amount of discount points in 
cash, only up to two discount points can be included in the loan amount. 
 
Although VA does not require an appraisal or credit underwriting on 
IRRRLs, any customary and reasonable credit report or appraisal expense 
incurred by a lender to satisfy its lending requirements may be charged to the 
borrower and included in the loan. 
 
The lender may also set the interest rate on the new loan high enough to 
enable the lender to pay all closing costs, as long as the requirements for 
lower interest rate and payments (or one of the exceptions to those 
requirements) are met. 
 
For IRRRLs to refinance loans 30 days or more past due (which must be 
submitted for prior approval), the following can be included in the new loan: 
 
 late payments and late charges on the old loan, and 
 reasonable costs if legal action to terminate the old loan has commenced.

IRRRL.  Therefore, the general rule is that the borrower cannot receive cash 
proceeds from the loan.  If necessary, the refinancing loan amount must be 
rounded down to avoid payments of cash to the veteran. 
 
The one exception is reimbursement of the veteran for the cost of energy 
efficiency improvements up to $6,000 completed within the 90 days 
immediately preceding the date of loan closing.

Receive Cash at  7. 
Closing? 
 
(continued) 
In a limited number of situations, the borrower may receive cash at closing.  
Some examples of situations in which VA does not object to the borrower 
receiving cash are: 
 
 computational errors, 
 changes in final pay-off figures, 
 up-front fees paid for the appraisal and/or credit report that are later added 
into the loan, and 
 refund of the escrow balance on the old loan.  This often occurs when a 
party other than the present holder originates the loan. 
 
VA does not set a “ceiling” or a specific dollar limitation on cash refunds 
resulting from adjustments at closing.  However, if a situation involves a 
borrower receiving more than $500, consult VA as to its acceptability.  
Lenders and VA personnel should exercise common sense when assessing 
such situations and draw from basic program information to know the 
difference between an equity withdrawal and cash from unforeseen 
circumstances. 
 
g. Maximum  Always use VA Form 26-8923, IRRRL Worksheet, to calculate the maximum 
Loan  loan amount.  The maximum loan amount is the existing VA loan balances 
plus the following: 
 
 including any late payments* and late charges, plus  
 allowable fees and charges (includes up to two discount points), plus  
 the cost of any energy efficiency improvements, and 
 the VA funding fee. 
 
*Any IRRRL that includes delinquent payments in the loan amount must be 
submitted for prior approval, even when a lender has automatic authority.

g. Maximum  Note:  There is no maximum dollar amount for VA loans.  Since an IRRRL 
Loan  rolls the above items into the new loan, and VA guarantees at least 25 percent 
(continued)  of the loan amount (without regard to the veteran’s entitlement), the new loan 
amount may be more than the limits established by the secondary market.  It 
is the lender’s responsibility to ensure it has a marketable loan. 
  
h. Amount of  No additional charge is made to the veteran’s entitlement for an IRRRL; such 
Guaranty and  as, the amount of the veteran’s previously used and available entitlement 
Entitlement Use  remains the same before and after obtaining the IRRRL. 
 
The new IRRRL loan amount may be equal to, greater than, or less than, the 
original amount of the loan being refinanced.  This may impact the amount of 
guaranty on the new loan, but not the veteran’s use of entitlement.  
 
Example Of New Loan Amount More Than Old Loan  
The existing VA loan was originally made for $110,000 with a guaranty of 
$27,500, or 25 percent.  The new IRRRL is for $112,000.  The guaranty on 
the new loan is $28,000 or 25 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use 
remains at $27,500. 
 
Example Of New Loan Amount Less Than Old Loan 
The existing VA loan was originally made for $42,000 with a guaranty of 
$25,000, or almost 60 percent (the percentage applicable under former law).  
The new IRRRL is for $40,000.  The guaranty on the new loan is $20,000 or 
50 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use remains at $25,000. 
 
Amount  How to calculate the amount of guaranty on an IRRRL 
IRRRLs  First, calculate the lesser of: 
up to   
$45,000   50 percent of the IRRRL loan amount, or 
 the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. 
 
The amount of guaranty is the greater of: 
 
 the above result, or 
 25 percent of the IRRRL loan amount.

k. Who Can an  Generally, the party(ies) obligated on the original loan must be the same on 
IRRRL be  the new loan (and the veteran must still own the property).   
Made to?   
The lender should contact VA regarding a proposed IRRRL involving a 
change in obligors unless the acceptability of the IRRRL is clear.  Sample 
cases are provided in the table in this subsection. 
 
Examples: 
 
In Case 7, the divorced spouse is keeping the home and wishes to refinance.  
The spouse cannot get an IRRRL unless the veteran agrees to be obligated on 
the new loan and commit his or her entitlement to the new loan.  A person 
without entitlement cannot get an IRRRL or any other type of VA loan. 
 
In Cases 8 through 10, the applicants cannot obtain an IRRRL because they 
do not include the veteran or a person who was the veteran’s spouse at the 
time the original loan was made, and who was obligated on the loan along 
with the veteran. 
 
In the case of the unmarried veteran obtaining the original loan (Case 8): 
 
 the marriage and death of the veteran occurred after the loan was made, and 
 the deceased veteran’s spouse is not obligated on the original loan.  Thus, 
an IRRRL is not possible. 
 
In the case of the veteran and spouse obligated on the original loan (Case 9): 
 
 the divorce, remarriage, then death of the veteran occurred after the loan 
was made and,  
the deceased veteran’s new spouse is not obligated on the original loan. 
Thus, an IRRRL is not possible.

1. Joint Loans 
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety  
 
a. What is a  “Joint loan” generally refers to a loan for which the: 
VA Joint   
Loan?   Veteran and other person(s) are liable, and 
 Veteran and the other obligor(s) own the security. 
 
 A joint loan is a loan made to the: 
 
 Veteran and one or more non-Veterans (not spouse),  
 Veteran and one or more Veterans (not spouse) who will not be using their 
entitlement, 
 Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, and both 
entitlement will be used; or 
 Veteran and one or more other Veterans (not spouse), all of who will use 
their entitlement. 
 
A loan involving a Veteran and his or her spouse will not be treated as a “joint 
loan” if the spouse is:  
 
 not a Veteran, or 
 a Veteran who will not be using his or her entitlement on the loan. 
 
A loan to a Veteran and fiancé who intend to marry prior to loan closing and 
take title as Veteran and spouse will be treated as a loan to a Veteran and 
spouse (conditioned upon their marriage), and not a joint loan.  
 
b. Regulations  The regulations in 38 C.F.R. 36.4307 address joint loans. 
 
c.  For purposes of applying the principles explained in this section, this term will 
Terminology  also be used to represent any other type of joint loan involving at least one 
Used in This  Veteran using his or her entitlement, and at least one other person not using 
Section    entitlement (can be a Veteran or a non-Veteran, but not a spouse). 
 
                                                                                           Continued on next page

Used in This    Three Veterans using entitlement and one non-Veteran 
Section,    One Veteran using entitlement and four non-Veterans 
continued    Two Veterans using entitlement and two Veterans not using                         
entitlement  
 
Two Veterans Joint Loan: Commonly meaning a loan involving two Veterans  
who are not married to each other and both are using their entitlement.  
 
For purposes of applying the principles explained in this section, this term will

each of whom uses his or her entitlement.  
 
This may also include loans to the following:  
 
 The Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, if both 
entitlements will be used.  
 Entitlement and funding fees are separate. Funding fees are always 
calculated equally by the number of people on the loan.  It is based on 
each Veteran paying their equal share of the loan.  
 On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the funding fee is based on half of the 
base loan amount, downpayment, and sales price for the correct funding 
fee charge. 
 VA will only guarantee the Veteran’s portion of the total loan amount.  
  
 
d. Occupancy   The Veteran using entitlement on a joint loan must certify intent to personally 
occupy the property as his or her home.

g. How to  The following underwriting considerations apply: 
Underwrite a  Type of Joint Loan  Underwriting Considerations Function 
Joint Loan  Two Veteran Joint  Consider the credit and combined income and 
Loan  assets of both parties.  Strengths of one Veteran 
related to income and/or assets may compensate for 
income/asset weaknesses of the other.  However, 
satisfactory credit of one Veteran cannot 
compensate for the other’s poor credit. 
Veteran/Non-Veteran  Veteran’s credit must be satisfactory and Veteran’s 
Joint Loan  income must be sufficient to repay that portion of 
the loan allocable to the non-Veteran.  The credit of 
the non-Veteran must be satisfactory.  However, 
the combined income of both borrowers can be 
considered in evaluating repayment ability.   
 
In other words: 
  income strength of the Veteran may 
compensate for income weakness of the 
non-Veteran, but  
  income strength of the non-Veteran cannot 
compensate for income weakness of the 
Veteran in analyzing the Veteran’s ability to 
repay his or her allocable portion of the 
loan.

i. Procedure  Step  Action 
1  Divide the total loan amount by the number of borrowers. 
2  Multiply the result by the number of Veteran-borrowers who will be 
using entitlement on the loan. 
 
There is usually only one Veteran borrower, in which case the result 
of this Step is the same as the result of Step 1.  
3  Calculate the maximum potential guaranty on the portion of the loan 
arrived at in Step 2 (as if that portion was the total loan). 
4  VA will guarantee the lesser of: 
 
  the maximum potential guaranty amount arrived at in Step 3, 
or 
  the combined available entitlement of all Veteran-borrowers.  
5  VA makes a charge to the Veteran-borrower’s available entitlement 
in the amount of the guaranty. 
 
If more than one Veteran is involved, VA divides the entitlement 
charge equally between them, if possible.  If only unequal 
entitlement is available, unequal charges may be made with the 
written agreement of the Veterans.

q. Equal  The applicability of the guaranty to only a portion of the loan in the case of a 
Credit  Veteran/non-Veteran joint loan may cause a lender to refuse to accept an 
Opportunity  application for such loan. 
Act   
Consideration This may appear to conflict with the ECOA prohibition against discrimination 
-s (ECOA)  based on marital status; however, the lender may refuse the application under 
these circumstances without violating ECOA. 
 
This is based on an exemption for VA being a special purpose credit program. 
 
r. Calculation  Apply the appropriate funding fee percentage to any portion of the loan   
of the Funding  allocable to a Veteran using his or her entitlement who is not exempt from the 
Fee  funding fee. Determine the appropriate percentage for the type of Veteran 
involved from the funding fee tables in Chapter 8. 
 
Example.  On a no-downpayment loan to two Veterans; on a first-time 
homebuyer; and on a subsequent user; the funding fee percentages of 2.15 
percent and 3.3 percent respectively would each be applied to one-half of the 
loan amount. 
 
No funding fee will be assessed on any portion of a joint loan allocable to a: 
 
 Non-Veteran 
 Veteran who did not use his or her entitlement, or 
 Veteran who used his or her entitlement, but is exempt from the funding 
fee. 
 
Downpayment.  The actual loan amount is allocated equally between the 
borrowers for purposes of calculating the funding fee, whether or not a 
downpayment is made, and regardless of where the funds for such a 
downpayment come from. 
 
 Example.  On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the non-Veteran makes a $5,000 
(five percent) downpayment out of his cash resources, to purchase a $100,000 
property, resulting in a $95,000 loan amount. The Veteran is a first-time 
homebuyer.  The Veteran must pay a funding fee of $712.50, based on 1.5 
percent of his/her $47,500 portion.

2. Construction/Permanent Home Loans 
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety  
 
a. The Basics  VA will guarantee a “construction/permanent home loan,” that is, a loan to 
finance the construction/purchase of a residence.  The loan is closed prior to 
the start of construction with proceeds disbursed to cover the cost of, or 
balance owed on, the land, and the balance into escrow.  The escrowed 
monies are paid out to the builder during construction. 
 
The lender must obtain written approval from the borrower before each draw 
payment is provided to the builder.  The loan will not be guaranteed until 
construction is complete and all Notice of Value (NOV) conditions are met. 
 
This section does not address other construction loans guaranteed by VA; that 
is, those for the purchase of a residence newly constructed for the Veteran by 
a builder who financed the construction from his or her own resources. 
 
Lenders should have the specialized experience to originate, process, 
underwrite (borrower, project, and builder), close, service and administer such 
loans.  These types of loans and projects inherently have uncertain elements 
that require careful examination.

b.  The Veteran begins making payments on a construction/permanent home loan 
Amortization  only after construction is complete.  Therefore, the initial payment on the 
principal may be postponed up to 1 year, if necessary.  The loan must be 
amortized to achieve full repayment within its remaining term.  The lender 
must provide evidence of the amortization in the loan file. 
 
Example.  If it takes 6 months to complete construction, the payment schedule 
for the Veteran obtaining a 30-year mortgage must provide for full repayment 
of the loan in 29 years and 6 months.

b.  Rather than requiring a balloon payment, it may be preferable to set up equal

continued  to repay the loan within the original maturity without a balloon payment. 
 
The VA requirement that loans be amortized with approximately equal 
payments and the principal must be reduced at least once annually, also 
applies to construction loans.  However, the final installment may be for an 
amount up to five percent of the original principal amount of the loan.

 hazard insurance during construction, and 
 property taxes. 
 
 
d. Interest  Lender’s may offer a “ceiling-floor” where the Veteran “floats” the interest 
Rate  rate during construction. The agreement must provide that at lock-in, the 
permanent interest rate will not exceed a specific maximum interest rate and 
permit the borrower to lock-in at a lower rate based on market fluctuations.  
The borrower must qualify for the mortgage at the maximum rate.

Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. What are  Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) are loans to cover the cost of making   
EEMs?  energy efficiency improvements to a dwelling.  They can be made in 
conjunction with a: 
 
  VA loan for the purchase of an existing dwelling, or 
  VA refinancing loan secured by the dwelling. 
 
Acceptable energy efficiency improvements include, but are not limited to: 
 
  solar heating systems, including solar systems for heating water for 
domestic use; 
  solar heating and cooling systems; 
  caulking and weather-stripping; 
  furnace efficiency modifications limited to replacement burners,  
boilers, or furnaces designed to reduce the firing rate or to achieve a 
reduction in the amount of fuel consumed as a result of increased 
combustion efficiency, devices for modifying flue openings which will 
increase the efficiency of the heating system, and electrical or mechanical 
furnace ignition systems which replace standing gas pilot lights; 
  clock thermostats; 
  new or additional ceiling, attic, wall and floor insulation; 
  water heater insulation; 
  storm windows and/or doors, including thermal windows and/or doors; 
  heat pumps; and 
  vapor barriers. 
 
b. Borrower  Information on EEMs is provided to a Veteran who applies for a loan which

amount may be increased as a result of making energy efficiency 
improvements such as: Solar or conventional heating/cooling systems, water 
heaters, insulation, weather-stripping/caulking, and storm windows/doors.  
Other energy related improvements may also be considered.” 
 
The mortgage may be increased by: 
 
  Up to $3,000 based solely on the documented costs, 
  Up to $6,000 provided the increase in monthly mortgage payment 
does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, or 
  VA does not permit EEMs more than $6,000 (38 U.S.C. §3710(d)). 
 
 
 
c. Underwriting  Energy efficiency improvements up to $3,000: The resulting increase in loan 
Considerations  payments will normally be offset by a reduction in utility costs. 
 
Energy efficiency improvements more than $3,000, up to $6,000: The lender 
must make a determination that the increase in monthly mortgage payments 
does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, and must rely 
on locally available information provided by utility companies, 
municipalities, state agencies or other reliable sources, and document the 
determination. 
 
Energy efficiency improvements in conjunction with an Interest Rate 
Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL). If the monthly payment (Principal, 
Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI)) for the new loan exceeds the PITI of 
the loan being refinanced by 20 percent or more, the lender must certify to 
having determined that the Veteran qualified for the higher payment.

e. How to  Guaranty is calculated on an EEM as described in the following table.  
Calculate   
Guaranty and  Step                                                      Action 
Entitlement  1  Calculate guaranty on the loan without the portion attributable to    
Use?    the energy efficiency improvements. 
2  Calculate guaranty on the energy efficiency improvements  
portion by applying the same percentage used in Step 1. 
3  Add the results of Steps 1 and 2 to arrive at guaranty on the entire  
loan. 
 
However, the Veteran’s entitlement will only be charged the amount arrived 
at in Step 1; it is based upon the loan amount before adding the cost of the 
energy efficiency improvements. 
 
Example 1: If a Veteran has full entitlement and applies for a loan of 
$80,000, plus $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, VA will guarantee 
40 percent of the full loan amount of $86,000. Thus, the dollar amount of 
the guaranty will be $34,400, even though the charge to the Veteran’s 
entitlement is only $32,000. 
 
Example 2: If a Veteran with full entitlement applies for a $144,000 loan to 
purchase a home, and adds $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, the 
25 percent guaranty on the loan will only require the use of $36,000 
entitlement, but the dollar amount of guaranty will be $37,500.

Check the appropriate block in item 23, VA Form 26-1820, Report and            
Certification of Loan Disbursement. 
 
  No additional documentation concerning the escrowed/earmarked funds 
must be submitted when reporting the closed loan. 
 
Generally, the improvements should be completed within 6 months from the 
date of loan closing. 
 
Provide written notification to VA when improvements are completed          
and the escrow funds are disbursed.  Escrow requirements concerning 
completion of improvements are listed in Chapter 9 of this handbook.  
 
  Assure the funds are properly applied to the costs of improvements. 
 
If, after a reasonable time, the lender determines that the improvements will 
not be completed: 
 
  Apply the balance of the escrowed/earmarked funds to reduce the  
      principal balance on the loan, and 
  Provide written notification to VA that this has been done.

continued  NOV and compliance inspections are required. 
 
If the cost of the repairs, alterations, or improvements does not exceed $3,500: 
an NOV and compliance inspections are not required.  Instead, a statement of 
reasonable value may be submitted.  The statement must be completed and 
signed by a VA-designated appraiser.  A VA-designated appraiser is an 
individual nominated by the lender (who may be an officer, trustee, or 
employee of the lender or its agent) who has been approved by the local VA 
office.   
 
The statement must specify the: 
 
  work done or to be done, 
 purchase price or cost of the work and material, and 
 purchase price or cost does not exceed the reasonable value. 
 
 In lieu of VA compliance inspections, the lender must submit a certification 
as follows: 
 
“The undersigned lender certifies to the Department of Veterans Affairs that 
the property as repaired, altered, or improved has been inspected by a 
qualified individual designated by the undersigned, and based on the

 If the supplemental loan will be consolidated with a related outstanding 
guaranteed loan, VA will issue a new modified guaranty certificate. 
 
 
g. Procedure  If the Veteran has no available entitlement, VA can still guarantee the 
supplemental loan provided the lender is the holder of the Veteran’s existing 
loan and the loans are to be consolidated. 
 
The amount of the modified guaranty will be the maximum guaranty 
effective on the existing loan at the time the supplemental loan is closed. 
 
To calculate the percentage of guaranty applicable to the combined 
indebtedness take the result of Step 1, and divide by the result of Step 3.  
 
Follow the steps in the table below to calculate the percentage of guaranty 
applicable to the combined indebtedness. 
   Step  Action 
1  Take the balance of the existing loan at the time of closing of the 
supplemental loan and multiply by the percentage of guaranty for the 
existing loan, as shown on the guaranty certificate. 
2  Calculate the amount of guaranty that would be issued on the 
supplemental loan as an independent loan (do not exceed the amount 
of entitlement available to the Veteran). 
3  Take the balance of the existing loan and add the amount of the 
supplemental loan. 
4  Take the result of Step 1 above and add the result of Step 2 above. 
5  Divide by the result of Step 3 above.

Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. Description  As a marketing tool, builders, sellers, or lenders will sometimes establish and 
fund escrows to temporarily reduce a borrower’s loan payments during the 
initial years of the mortgage.  The borrower may also fund such an escrow for 
herself/himself as a financial management tool. 
 
VA will guaranty loans involving temporary interest rate buydowns, if 
otherwise eligible. 
 
A temporary interest rate buydown can be used in conjunction with any type 
of VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
b. Escrow  Funds must be safely escrowed with an independent third-party escrow agent 
Agreements  beyond the reach of prospective creditors of the builder, seller, lender, and the 
borrower. 
 
Exception.  If the Federal National Mortgage Association is the holder, it may 
take custody of the funds. 
 
The escrow agent must make payments directly to the lender or servicer.  The 
funds may be used only for payments due on the note.  The funds may not be 
used to pay past due monthly loan payments. If the loan is foreclosed or 
prepaid, the funds must be credited against the Veteran’s indebtedness. 
 
Escrowed funds may not revert to the party that established the escrow.  If    
the property is sold subject to, or on an assumption of the loan, the escrow   
must continue to pay out on behalf of the new owner.

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Policy  The VA Home Loan program involves a veteran’s benefit.  VA policy has 
evolved around the objective of helping the veteran to use his or her home 
loan benefit.  Therefore, VA regulations limit the fees that the veteran can pay 
to obtain a loan. 
 
Lenders must strictly adhere to the limitations on borrower-paid fees and 
charges when making VA loans. 
  
b.  The VA  In order to defray the cost of administering the VA Home Loan program, each 
Funding Fee  veteran must pay a funding fee to VA at loan closing.  
 
Congress may periodically change the funding fee rates to reflect changes in 
the cost of administering the program, or to assist a certain class of veterans.

Loans  improvement, or repair loans. 
 
If the lender supervises the progress of construction and/or makes advances to 
a veteran in excess of 50 percent of the loan during construction, alteration, 
improvement, or repair, then the lender may charge the veteran up to two 
percent of the loan amount in addition to the lender’s one percent flat charge.  
 
Example:  Total charges to the veteran in these cases would be, at a   
maximum, itemized fees and charges plus a three percent flat charge plus  
discount points. 
 
If the lender does not supervise the progress of construction or make advances 
to a veteran in excess of 50 percent of the loan during construction, alteration, 
improvement, or repair, then the lender may charge the veteran up to one 
percent of the loan amount in addition to the lender’s one percent flat charge. 
 
Example:  Total charges to the veteran in these cases would be, at a 
maximum, itemized fees and charges plus a two percent flat charge plus 
discount points. 
 
This provision also applies to supplemental loans.

“itemized fees and charges.”  The lender may pay third parties for services or 
do as it wishes with the funds from the flat charge, as long as the lender 
complies with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).   
 
Section 2, subsections c and d, of this chapter provide some examples of 
items that cannot be charged to the veteran as “itemized fees and charges.”  
 
This section provides more examples of items that cannot be paid by the 
veteran, but can be paid out of the lender’s flat charge or by some party other 
than the veteran. 
  
b.  Attorney’s  The lender may not charge the borrower for attorney’s fees.  However, 
Fees  reasonable fees for title examination work and title insurance can be paid by 
the borrower.  They are allowable itemized fees and charges.  
 
VA does not intend to prevent the veteran from seeking independent legal 
representation.  Therefore, the veteran can independently retain an attorney 
and pay a fee for legal services in connection with the purchase of a home.  
Closing documents should clearly indicate that the attorney’s fee is not being 
charged by the lender, but is being paid by the veteran as part of an 
independent arrangement with an attorney.

c.  Brokerage  Fees or commissions charged by a real estate agent or broker in connection 
Fees  with a VA loan may not be charged to or paid by the veteran-purchaser.   
 
While use of “buyer” brokers is not precluded, veteran-purchasers may not, 
under any circumstances, be charged a brokerage fee or commission in 
connection with the services of such individuals.  Since information on 
property available for purchase and financing options is widely available to 
the public from a variety of sources, VA does not believe that preventing the 
veteran from paying buyer-broker fees will harm the veteran. 
  
d.  Prepayment  A veteran obtaining a VA refinancing loan cannot use loan proceeds to pay

A veteran purchasing a property with a VA loan cannot pay penalty costs 
required to discharge any existing liens on the seller’s property.

5. Seller Concessions 
  
Change Date  November 08, 2010, Change 15 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Definition  For the purposes of this topic, a seller concession is anything of value added 
to the transaction by the builder or seller for which the buyer pays nothing 
additional and which the seller is not customarily expected or required to pay 
or provide.   
  
b.  Seller  Seller concessions include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Concessions   
• payment of the buyer’s VA funding fee 
• prepayment of the buyer’s property taxes and insurance 
• gifts such as a television set or microwave oven 
• payment of extra points to provide permanent interest rate buydowns 
• provision of escrowed funds to provide temporary interest rate buydowns, 
and 
• payoff of credit balances or judgments on behalf of the buyer. 
 
Seller concessions do not include payment of the buyer’s closing costs, or 
payment of points as appropriate to the market. 
 
Example:  If the market dictates an interest rate of 7½ percent with two 
discount points, the seller’s payment of the two points would not be a seller 
concession.  If the seller paid five points, three of these points would be 
considered a seller concession. 
  
c.  The Problem  In some localities, builders or sellers offer concessions as a competitive tool.  
In extreme cases, the concessions may entice unwary and unqualified veterans 
into home mortgages they cannot afford.  The concessions may disguise the 
veteran’s inability to qualify for the loan.

compensation, a copy of the original VA notification of disability rating and 
documentation of the veteran’s service retirement income, or 
• indications on the Certificate of Eligibility (COE) that the borrower is 
entitled as an unmarried surviving spouse. 
 
Consult VA if the borrower’s status is unclear after reviewing the appropriate 
documents, or if conflicting information is found.

VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) of jurisdiction for assistance confirming the 
exempt status.

g.  How to Use  The lender must find the appropriate percentage in the tables using the 
the Funding  following parameters: 
Fee Tables   
• Is the veteran eligible for VA loan benefits through service in the regular 
military or the Reserves/National Guard?  Examine the COE.  For 
Reserves/National Guard, the COE bears the notation, 
“RESERVES/NATIONAL GUARD - INCREASED FUNDING FEE,” and 
is buff-colored rather than green. 
• Is the veteran a subsequent user of VA home loan benefits or obtaining his 
or her first VA loan?  Examine the COE.  An entitlement code of “5” 
indicates subsequent use, as does a loan number entered in the “Loan 
Number” column.  
• What type of loan is the veteran obtaining?  The funding fee varies 
depending upon whether the loan is a purchase or construction loan, an 
IRRRL, or a cash-out refinancing loan. 
• Is the veteran making a downpayment of at least five or ten percent? 
− Calculate what percentage of the sales price of the property the veteran is 
remitting as a downpayment. 
− The downpayment may come from the veteran’s own resources or 
borrowed funds.  Except, if the purchase price exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property, the difference between the purchase price and the 
reasonable value must be paid by the veteran in cash without borrowing. 
• For construction loans only, equity in the secured property counts as a 
downpayment for calculating the funding fee.

Lenders must ensure that the security instruments they use: 
 
  establish the required lien 
  comply with the laws and regulations governing VA’s home loan 
program 
  comply with applicable state laws, and 
  contain the following VA clauses:

c. Other  The mortgage or deed of trust must contain four additional clauses related to 
Clauses  the assumption of the loan.  VA does not specifically require that these 
clauses also be included in the note, unless this is required under state law to 
make them enforceable. Due to variations in local laws, the lender should 
obtain legal guidance as to any minor changes in these sample clauses which 
may be necessary to ensure that they have the effect required by the law and 
regulations; that is, the lender does not have to use the exact language 
provided for these four clauses. 
 
Acceleration Clause 
This loan may be declared immediately due and payable upon transfer of the 
property securing such loan to any transferee, unless the acceptability of the 
assumption of the loan is established pursuant to 38 U.SC. 3714. 
 
Funding Fee Clause 
A fee equal to one-half of one percent of the balance of this loan as of the date 
of transfer of the property shall be payable at the time of transfer to the loan 
holder or its authorized agent, as trustee for the VA. If the assumer fails to pay 
this fee at the time of transfer, the fee shall constitute an additional debt to that 
already secured by this instrument, shall bear interest at the rate herein 
provided, and at the option of the payee of the indebtedness hereby secured or 
any transferee thereof, shall be immediately due and payable.  This fee is 
automatically waived if the assumer is exempt under the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 3729(c). 
 
Processing Charge Clause  
Upon application for approval to allow assumption of this loan, a processing 
fee may be charged by the loan holder or its authorized agent for determining 
the creditworthiness of the assumer and subsequently revising the holder’s 
ownership records when an approved transfer is completed. The amount of 
this charge shall not exceed the maximum established by VA for a loan to 
which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies. 
 
Indemnity Liability Assumption Clause 
If this obligation is assumed, then the assumer hereby agrees to assume all of 
the obligations of the Veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and 
securing the loan. The assumer further agrees to indemnify VA to the extent 
of any claim payment arising from the guaranty or insurance of the 
indebtedness created by this instrument.

Change Date  July 30, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Sales  The Escape Clause must be contained in the sales contract for all VA-
Contract  guaranteed loans.   The lender is responsible for ensuring that the paragraph is 
in the sales contract prior to closing.  In the event the clause is not in the sales 
contract, VA may not guaranty the loan. 
 
b. Builders and  The builders/realtors that initiate contracts on new construction must ensure 
Realtors  that the Escape Clause is in the contract and the contract is signed by the 
Veteran and seller. 
 
c. Upgrades  Upgrades are not considered earnest money and the builder is not required to 
refund this money.  When the NOV is below the sales contract price, this 
clause protects the Veteran with negotiation of the sales contract. 
 
d. Escape  If the sales contract was signed by the Veteran prior to receipt of the NOV, 
Clause  the contract must include, or be amended to include, the clause below. 
 
“It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
contract, the purchaser shall not incur any penalty by forfeiture of earnest 
money or otherwise or be obligated to complete the purchase of the property 
described herein, if the contract purchase price or cost exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property established by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The 
purchaser shall, however, have the privilege and option of proceeding with the 
consummation of this contract without regard to the amount of the reasonable 
value established by the Department of Veterans Affairs (38 U.S.C. 501, 
3703(c)(1)).”

Veteran in the  estate of a Veteran in real property securing a VA-guaranteed loan. 
Property   
The lender is responsible for ensuring the loan conforms to these parameters.  
For IRRRLs (see Chapter 6, Topic 6, Item k of this handbook). 
 
A beneficial interest in a revocable Family Living Trust that ensures that the 
Veteran, or Veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the 
lien attaches to any remainder interest and the trust arrangement is valid under 
state law. 
   
b. Estate Title   Generally, title to the estate shall be that which is acceptable to informed 
buyers, title companies, and attorneys in the community in which the 
property is situated. 
   
c. Mortgage  VA does not allow an individual to take title to a property if that individual is  
Note or Deed  not on either the mortgage note or a mortgage deed of trust.  Accordingly, if  
a spouse or other owner does not want to sign a mortgage note and be  
obligated for a VA-guaranteed home loan that individual must sign a  
mortgage deed of trust. 
   
d.  Title  VA does not require a lender making a VA loan or the Veteran-borrower to  
Insurance  obtain title insurance.  The lender may apply its own title insurance 
requirements to VA loan transactions.  VA requires only that title to the

  Under 38 C.F.R. 36.4309(b), VA may guarantee a loan made through 
a state, territorial, or local government program where restrictions in 
the legal instruments require acceleration of the loan if it is assumed 
by a party ineligible for assistance under the program. 
  Such acceleration must be mandated by federal, state, territorial, or 
local law or regulation. 
 
VA may guarantee a loan made through a state or local government program, 
designed to assist low-or moderate-income individuals, which imposes 
resale and price restrictions on purchasers.  Under such a program, if the 
property is resold within a period established by local law or ordinance, 
certain restrictions as set forth in 38 C.F.R. 36.4354(b)(5)(iv)(A) on to whom 
the property may be sold, the resale price, and other restrictions approved by 
the Secretary may be applied. 
 
VA may guarantee a loan on which a title restriction limits the sale, lease, or 
occupancy of the dwelling to persons based on age, including a prohibition 
against the permanent occupancy of the dwelling by children, provided such 
restriction complies with applicable federal law (38 U.S.C. 3704(c)).   
 
VA may refuse to approve a property with an age restriction if its operation 
would create an undue hardship upon the owner in the case of sudden, 
unforeseen events or be likely to result in an increased risk of loan default.

Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Policy  Loans for the purchase and construction of homes will be first liens, subject 
only to taxes, special assessments, and ground rents.  VA will not approve 
superior liens in favor of private entities unless they: 
 
  are legally or practically necessary, and 
  result in no prejudice to the Veterans or the Government. 
   
b.  The lender must obtain VA prior approval of liens held by private parties 
Requirements  which are superior to VA home mortgage liens.  Liens held by mandatory 
membership home associations in planned unit developments are not 
addressed in this topic.  The lender must demonstrate that: 
 
  it is not legal or practical to subordinate the superior lien to the VA 
mortgage, 
  there is a viable rationale for not subordinating the superior lien, 
  the superior lien will not prejudice Veterans or the Government, and 
  if periodic charges or assessments are involved, the amounts are 
reasonable and limits on the amounts have been established. 
 
   
c. VA Approval  Always obtain VA approval before the lien is recorded. Builders and 
developers should be aware that if they plan to market properties through VA 
financing, covenants creating superior liens should not be recorded without  
VA approval.

36.4356): 
 
  Liens for taxes, assessments, and ground rents. 
  Liens by private entities to secure assessments or charges for 
municipal- type services and facilities which: 
o  are clearly governmental in nature, and  
o  a municipality could support out of public tax revenue if it

them. 
  Liens to implement or augment a service or facility if the 
government’s provision of such service or facility is inadequate. 
  Liens for services or facilities in locations where the services or 
facilities are adequately supplied by local government generally will 
not be approved by VA.

secure the homeowner’s share of the costs of the management, 
operation, maintenance, services, or programs for the benefit of a 
development. 
  Liens (on existing properties) previously retained by trustees,

8.  Power of Attorney (POA) 
    
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Policy  VA will allow a Veteran to use an attorney-in-fact to execute any documents 
necessary to obtain a VA-guaranteed loan.  This enables active duty 
servicepersons stationed overseas, and other Veterans who cannot be present 
to execute loan documents, to obtain VA loans. 
 
b.  The Veteran must execute a general or specific POA which is valid and 
Requirements  legally adequate.  The Veteran’s attorney-in-fact (as specified in the POA) 
must use this POA to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and initiate 
processing of a loan on behalf of the Veteran.  A military POA is considered a 
general POA and is only valid during the Active Duty Servicemembers’ 
(ADSM) period of deployment, not to exceed 1 year. 
 
To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, ensure that the 
general or specific POA complies with state law to the extent that: 
 
  the mortgage can be legally enforced in that jurisdiction, and 
  clear title can be conveyed in the event of foreclosure. 
 
To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, VA also requires 
the Veteran’s written consent to the specifics of the transaction either through 
a general POA or a specific POA. 
 
General POA - The Veteran’s signature on both the sales contract and the 
Uniform Residential Loan Application, as long as the Veteran’s intention to 
obtain a VA loan on the particular property is expressed somewhere in those 
documents.

on (date), was examined by the undersigned and that the said date is on or 
subsequent (not prior) to the date the note and security instruments were 
executed on the Veteran’s behalf by the attorney-in-fact.” 
 
VA may deny guaranty on a loan if the lender failed to properly verify the 
Veteran’s status and the Veteran was deceased (or MIA) at the time the loan 
was closed.

Construction 
     
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Procedures  Prior to requesting an appraisal of proposed construction, the lender must 
review the sales contract or purchase agreement on the property.  The lender 
must determine whether the contract: 
 
  is acceptable, and 
  does not contain unfair contractual provisions. 
    
b. Revisions  The lender must request revisions of an unacceptable contract by the parties 
to the transaction.  The lender should report unacceptable contract practices 
by a VA program participant (such as a builder) to VA if: 
 
  the program participant is engaged in practices which seriously 
prejudice the interests of Veterans or the Government, or 
  the program participant repeatedly uses unacceptable contracts or 
contracts containing unfair contractual provisions, and is 
uncooperative in changing such practices 
   
c. Closing  The closing of the loan indicates that the lender has determined the contract is 
acceptable. 
   
d. Examples of  Example  Unfair Contract Provisions or Features 
Unfair

2  Inclusion in a lump-sum contract of an “escalator clause” which 
obligates the purchaser to pay a higher price in the event of 
increased costs for labor, material, or other items prior to delivery 
of title unless accompanied by a proviso which gives the 
purchaser the option of canceling the contract and obtaining a 
refund of the moneys paid, if the increased price is not acceptable 
to the buyer/Veteran.

11.  Hazard Insurance 
  
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.

the loan, and includes insuring any secured property that becomes 
newly located in a SFHA due to FEMA remapping. 
 
  The VA appraiser’s opinion on whether the property is located in a 
SFHA does not relieve the lender from responsibility for ensuring 
flood insurance coverage on a property which is in fact located in a 
SFHA. 
 
  Personal property requiring coverage can include a manufactured 
home and its appliances, carpet, etc. if they secure the loan.

Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. General  VA permits Veteran purchasers to utilize HAP services when obtaining a VA 
Information  home loan. Both government and private entities administer HAPs. 
 
  Lenders are not required to obtain VA approval of such programs 
before closing the loan.  Homebuyer assistance programs that are 
administered by a state, county, or municipal government entity have 
blanket approval for use with VA loans.  These state and local 
programs are not to be confused with the Department of Defense 
HAP. 
  HAPs that do not fall under the blanket approval, should forward the 
documentation to the VA RLC with jurisdiction over property state.  
     
b.  Lenders making VA loans involving HAPs must ensure the following: 
Requirements   
  the borrower(s) meet(s) VA credit standards,  
  the lender obtains a VA appraisal, and  
  the property must meet VA minimum property standards. 
 
If the sale price of the property exceeds the VA reasonable value of the 
property, VA will only allow HAP assistance in the form of a grant to pay 
the difference.  Otherwise the Veteran must pay the difference of price 
over value from his or her own funds without borrowing. 
 
HAPs often require buyers to occupy the property for a specified period of 
time.  The lender must, at closing, obtain the borrower’s 
acknowledgement of this requirement, and provide a copy of the signed 
acknowledgement if VA requests the loan file for review.

c. HAP Fees  Chapter 8 of this handbook lists closing charges that Veteran-borrowers are not 
allowed to pay when a one-percent loan origination fee is charged.  Since HAPs 
are designed to assist low to moderate income buyers, lenders may not charge 
Veteran-borrowers unallowable fees and use HAP funds to offset these charges 
since this practice dilutes the assistance that the HAP was intended to provide.

Appraisal   described in the appraisal (see Chapter 12, Topic 12 of this 
Handbook). 
 
  A property that is primarily non-residential is ineligible for VA loan 
guaranty (see Chapter 12, Topic 11 of this Handbook). 
 
  For new and proposed construction cases, if the local building 
authority routinely performs construction inspections, but none were 
conducted, the property is ineligible for VA loan guaranty (see Topic 
14 of this chapter). 
 
  Condo-hotel properties (Condotels) where units are placed in a rental 
pool and “air” condominiums that do not have a homeowners 
association are not eligible for an appraisal. (see Chapter 11, Topic 12 
of this Handbook.) 
 
  A property is ineligible for an appraisal if any party of interest to the 
transaction, other than the purchaser, is debarred Government-wide, or 
excluded from participation in the Loan Guaranty program due to a 
VA-imposed sanction. Sanctions typically involve construction 
complaints or unfair marketing practices.  Lenders must confirm that 
builders of properties appraised as new or proposed construction have 
a valid VA-issued builder ID number to ensure that sanctioned 
builders do not participate in the VA Home Loan Guaranty program 
(see Topic 11 of this chapter). If the sanctioned party is a builder, this 
restriction applies to any property still owned by the builder, including 
houses under construction and existing houses.  VA’s refusal to 
appraise will not be affected by either the fact that the local building 
authority approved the work on which the sanction was based, or the 
builder changes the company’s name or organizational structure or 
becomes a principal or officer in another organization.

  Step  Action 
1  Obtain a user ID and password for the Veterans Information Portal (VIP) (see 
Chapter 10, Topic 2 of this Handbook) 
2  Ensure that the property is eligible for an appraisal.  Contact the RLC with any 
questions about property eligibility or if the property is not eligible, but is 
already the security for a VA loan 
3  Request for Certificate of Eligibility (COE) 
 
4  Log on to VIP and select WebLGY > Request Appraisal > Select Appraisal 
Type 
5  Input all requested information to generate VA Form 26-1805-1, VA Request 
for Determination of Reasonable Value 
6  To avoid a delay for the Veteran, provide a complete legal description and 
ensure that the Point of Contact’s (POC) information is correct and that the 
POC can provide access to the property for the appraiser without any 
additional calls 
7  WebLGY will: 
- assign a case number (in liquidation cases, this will be the existing VA loan 
number for the property that must be provided by the requester) 
- assign an appraiser (since VA is required by law to select the fee appraiser on 
a rotational basis from a panel maintained by VA)

  Step  Action 
8  If the Veteran is purchasing a home, the same day the assignment is made, the 
requester must upload a copy of the sales contract and any construction 
exhibits into WebLGY. VA highly recommends the use of reduced-size 
construction drawings to save copying, mailing, and storage costs for all 
parties involved. Building plans, elevations and details, traditionally drawn at 
¼ inch scale and larger, can be photographically reduced or computer-drawn 
to be clearly readable on 8½ by 14-inch pages. Other exhibits normally 
provided in an 8½ by 11-inch format (such as specifications, certifications, 
etc.) must not be further reduced.  VA does not accept 11 by 17-inch pages as 
this size is not compatible with scanning equipment generally available to 
program participants. 
9  For all appraisal types, if the legal description is lengthy and does not fit in the 
legal description block on the appraisal request, a copy of the complete legal 
description must be uploaded into WebLGY the same day the assignment is 
made. 
10  In most cases, the appraisal will be assigned instantly.  If an appraiser is not 
assigned by WebLGY, please notify the RLC of jurisdiction. Requesters must 
not re-enter the information as a duplicate appraisal request will be generated.

2. Market Value 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Market  The appraiser must estimate the market value, as "the most probable price that 
Value  a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions 
Definition  requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, 
knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.”  
VA considers reasonable value and market value to be synonymous.  VA’s 
definition of market value is consistent with that used by Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and major appraisal organizations.  
 
b. Protecting  The quality of the appraisal is critical in protecting the interests of Veterans, 
the Interests of  lenders, servicers, and VA.  This fact requires VA to be integrally involved in 
Veterans,  its management and oversight of the appraisal process, from the initial 
Lenders, 
assignment of the appraiser through the issuance of the Notice of Value 
Servicers and 
(NOV), as well as oversight performed on closed loans.

c. Oversight  Any appraisal report is unacceptable if the analysis is not based upon 
recognized appraisal practices and was intended to "accommodate" or "meet" 
the sales price.

, continued 
 
i. Appraisal  In most cases, the appraiser will prepare the appraisal on Fannie Mae Form 
Requirements  1073, Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report.  Appraisals of 
manufactured home condominium units must be prepared on Fannie Mae 
Form 1004C, Manufactured Home Appraisal Report, with the details about 
the condominium development usually provided in the Project Information 
Section of the condominium appraisal form included within the appraisal 
report.  Liquidation appraisals of condominium units must be prepared on 
Fannie Mae Form 1075, Exterior-Only Inspection Individual Condominium 
Unit Appraisal Report, if interior access was not provided.  In the 
Condominium Appraisal Report, the appraiser will: 
 
  indicate which utilities are included in the monthly 
homeowners association fee, 
  comment on the adequacy of the monthly assessment, 
based upon the appraiser’s opinion of the adequacy of the 
project’s budget and a comparison to similar 
condominium developments, 
  recommend a fair assessment if the current assessment is 
considered inadequate, and  
  report any known pending litigation involving the subject 
condominium development or its homeowners 
association. 
 
j. Pre-sale  For new condominium developments, a pre-sale requirement of 70 percent 
Requirement  must be included on the NOV and satisfied prior to VA loan guaranty. 
 
k. Wood- A wood-destroying insect inspection is not required on units in low-rise or 
destroying  high-rise condominiums (units are stacked vertically), unless the appraiser 
Insect Reports  notes a potential infestation problem.  For site condominiums and 
villa/townhome style condominiums where units are side by side, located in a 
“very heavy” or “moderate to heavy” zone, a wood-destroying insect 
inspection must be required on the NOV unless evidence of a treatment 
guarantee has been provided by the homeowners association.

13.  Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Definition  The UAD improves the quality and consistency of appraisal data by defining 
all fields required on specific appraisal forms and standardizes definitions and 
responses for a key subset of fields. Regardless of the geographic location of 
the property or any localized reporting conventions, the UAD standardization 
includes: 
 
  Formats for fields that include dates, values, and other data,  
  Allowable values from a list of choices provided for certain fields, 
  Abbreviations to allow more information to fit on printed appraisal 
forms, and  
  Ratings and definitions for the “Condition” and “Quality” of the 
property and “Updated/Remodeled” status. 
 
b. UAD- Appraisals prepared on Fannie Mae Forms 1004, 1073, 1075 or 2055 must be 
Compliant  UAD-compliant and must include the definitions for the property condition 
Forms  and quality ratings and the property description abbreviations used.  
 
c. VA Requires  While the UAD may allow for the use of pending sales in the sales 
Closed Sales  comparison grid, VA requires that only closed sales be used. 
 
d. Remodeling  UAD requires appraisers to provide specific information regarding 
Information  remodeling in the past 15 years.  VA expects fee appraisers to recognize and 
describe remodeling or updating and to make appropriate adjustments. Fee 
appraisers should also report UAD information concerning the remodeling if 
it is available in the “normal course of business” within VA timeliness 
requirements for completion of the appraisal. 
 
e. UAD  Since origination appraisals are prepared “subject to” any repairs needed for 
Condition  the property to meet MPRs, UAD condition ratings of C5 and C6 are not 
Ratings  appropriate.

14.  Sales Comparison Approach 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Comparable  The appraiser must include, at a minimum, three closed sales which the 
Sale Selection  appraiser believes are the best available sales and provide comments to 
support the selection, when appropriate.  Comparable sales should be selected 
based on similar locational and physical characteristics, not sales price.  
Recent sales in the same established subdivision, condominium or PUD are 
typically the best indicators of value.  The sales should be similar to the 
subject property to the extent that the sales would be competing properties if 
they were on the market at the same time as the subject property. 
 
b. Comments  The appraiser should provide comments when adjustments are made for 
Explaining  points of comparison that are not self-explanatory or when large adjustments 
Adjustments  are made.  Providing detailed commentary about the market and comparable 
selection may reduce the number of requests for revisions of appraisals. 
 
c. Limited Sales  If the sales data from the market area is limited, the appraiser must provide the 
Data  best information available and comments with the appraiser’s professional 
opinion about the market, any reasons for the lack of sales data, and the 
various differences between the subject and the comparable sales. 
 
d. Distance of  VA does not set minimum or maximum distance requirements between the 
Comparable  subject and comparable sale properties.  In suburban or rural communities, the 
Sales  market areas may be greatly expanded and suitable comparable sales may be 
many miles away from the subject. In such cases, the appraiser should specify 
why those comparable sales were used and how they compare with the 
subject.  
 
e. Sales of REO  The appraiser may use sales of Real Estate Owned (REO) properties or short 
Properties  sales if transactions of this nature are prevalent in the market.  A transaction 
involving a foreclosure transfer to a mortgage servicer is not evidence of 
market value and must not be considered as a comparable sale.

f. Sales From  If the property is in a new subdivision or condominium, the appraiser should 
Competing  include, if available for comparison, properties constructed by a competing 
Developments  builder in the subject market area as well as properties within the subject 
subdivision or condominium. 
 
g. Market- All adjustments on the market data grid should be market-derived, based on 
derived  the amount the appraiser estimates a typical buyer would pay for the item in 
Adjustments  the market.  Adjustments reflect contributory value in the market, which does 
not necessarily equal the cost of an item. 
 
h. Sales  Sales concessions typically include financing incentives or non-realty items.  
Concessions  As all adjustments must be market-derived, the adjustment should reflect the 
difference between the sales price with the sales concessions, and what the 
property would have sold for without the concessions under typical market 
conditions.  The sales concessions on the comparable properties are adjusted 
to typical market expectations, not to the specific terms or conditions of the 
sale of the subject. Any concession adjustments must be downward 
adjustments as positive adjustments for sales concessions are not acceptable. 
 
i. Recent Sales  Comparable sales should reflect the most recent activity in the market.  
Comparable sales are preferably sales that have taken place within the last 6 
months, and generally sales that are not more than 12-months old, unless 
explained by the appraiser.

j. Time  Market condition (time) adjustments are made to reflect value changes in the 
Adjustments  market between the date of the contract for the comparable sale and the 
effective date of the appraisal.  The appraiser must provide comments about 
current market trends to support any time adjustments.  
 
In an increasing market, positive market condition adjustments should be 
made if there is evidence, based on a thorough analysis of specific market 
trends, of increasing prices, a shortage of homes for sale, or decreasing 
marketing times. 
 
In a declining market, negative market condition adjustments should be made 
if there is evidence of a decline in prices, an oversupply, or extended 
marketing times.  
 
k. Condition  Since VA appraisals must be prepared “subject to” the completion of any 
Adjustments  repairs needed in order for the property to meet VA’s MPRs (see Chapter 12 
of this handbook), the condition for the subject property compared with the 
comparable sales on the market data grid should reflect the condition with the 
repair items completed.

Appraisal  the property for VA Loan Guaranty purposes in light of VA minimum property 
Review 
requirements and the appropriateness, completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the fee appraiser’s reasonable value determination. In completing 
this administrative review, I am performing a due diligence function and not 
acting as, or taking the responsibility of, a cosigner of the report or 
supervisory appraiser.  Any disagreements or comments, etc., resulting from 
the administrative review of this appraisal are fully explained on the 
attachment to this report.”  (WebLGY notes are considered “the attachment to 
this report” referenced in this certification).

Responsibilities  when initially approved by VA, the SAR is certifying that he/she: 
 
  personally reviewed the appraisal report (see Topic 3 of this Chapter), 
  concurred with the fee appraiser’s recommendation, except as 
noted in WebLGY notes, 
  did not exert pressure or undue influence on the appraiser to change 
information or to reach a predetermined value for the subject property 
in order to accommodate the sale price or mortgage transaction, and 
  determined that the appraiser used methodologies that were 
appropriate and reasonable in light of industry-accepted appraisal 
techniques, made conclusions that were consistent, based upon the 
data in the report, and complied with applicable VA requirements.

the property is properly valued according to VA-accepted appraisal principles 
and practices. 
 
b. Business  As a rules-based system, AMS will assist SARs in finding inconsistencies by 
Rules in AMS  flagging items as potentially problematic, and determining whether the 
appraisal is in compliance with VA appraisal requirements, industry-accepted 
appraisal principles, and Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice (USPAP). 
 
c. Alerts  Alerts will be noted by the AMS based on VA’s business rules.  All high 
Provided by  alerts must be addressed in WebLGY notes.  Medium and low alerts do not 
AMS  require a comment, but should be carefully reviewed by the SAR.  Often the 
alerts will reflect an NOV condition that must be required, with no 
clarification needed from the appraiser. 
 
d. VA Guidance  VA will issue a circular periodically describing the AMS scores that will be 
on Specific  considered low-risk and high-risk appraisals.  SARs may perform a cursory 
AMS Scores  review on low-risk appraisals.  High-risk appraisals require a comprehensive 
review. Sometimes a score of “N/A” will be reported for complex, rural, or 
new/proposed construction properties due to a lack of market data.  While this 
is not an indication of a high-risk appraisal, a comprehensive review must be 
performed since the AMS did not return a score within the acceptable range 
for a cursory review.   SARs must indicate whether or not a cursory review 
was performed in WebLGY with the indicator on the screen where the NOV 
is issued.

c. Table of   
NOV  NOV Condition  Details for including this condition on an NOV 
Conditions, 
1. Energy Conservation  Item 1a should be marked on NOVs for existing 
continued 
properties (over 1-year old or previously occupied) to 
allow lenders to increase the loan amount for Veterans 
wishing to make energy efficiency improvements (see 
Chapter 7 of this Handbook).  Item 1b should be 
marked on NOVs for new or proposed construction 
excluding manufactured homes. For new and proposed 
manufactured homes, energy efficiency is already 
covered by the manufacturer’s guidelines (see Chapter 
12, Topic 42 of this Handbook) so this item should not 
be marked.   
2.  Wood Destroying  If the property is located in an area on the Termite 
Insect Information  Infestation Probability Map where the probability of 
termite infestation is "very heavy" or "moderate to 
heavy," a wood destroying insect inspection report 
must be required on the Notice of Value (NOV).  Mark 
2a if the property is existing or new construction, or 
item 2b if the property is proposed. For new 
construction, if a soil treatment guarantee is provided, 
this is preferable and will satisfy condition 2a.  The 
pest control operator must meet all state requirements. 
State-required inspection forms are acceptable.  
Inspection reports are valid for 90 days.  Soil treatment 
guarantees differ from an inspection and are 
consequently valid well beyond 90 days.  A wood-
destroying insect inspection is not required on units in 
low-rise or high-rise condominiums (units are stacked 
vertically) unless the appraiser notes a potential 
infestation problem.  For site condominiums, and villa 
or townhome style condominiums where units are not 
vertically stacked, an inspection must be required on 
the NOV unless evidence of a treatment guarantee has 
been provided by the homeowners association.

homeowners association fees must be shown on the 
NOV.  Special assessments including local authorities 
collecting Community Development District (CDD) 
fees or other fees on the HOA’s behalf should be 
reported here as well.  
4. Condominium  If the condominium is conditionally accepted by VA, 
this item should be marked.  This item is not required 
if the condominium is fully accepted by VA.  If the 
condominium has not been accepted by VA, the NOV 
must not be issued.  (See Chapter 11, Topic 12 of this 
Handbook). 
5. Private Road/Shared  If access to the property is by a private road or shared 
Driveway  driveway, this item should be marked, unless the 
property is in a PUD or condominium with private 
streets which are covered by the organizational 
documents.  If a state law establishes requirements for 
the maintenance of private roads, this condition is not 
needed on the NOV.  
6. Flood Insurance  If the property is located in a Special Flood Hazard 
Area, this item must be marked. It is the lender's 
responsibility to ensure that flood insurance is 
obtained and maintained on properties located in 
SFHAs, whether or not the appraiser correctly 
identifies the property as being in an SFHA.  If flood 
insurance is not available, a property in a SFHA is not 
eligible to be the security for a VA-guaranteed loan. 
7. Water/Sewage  If the property has an individual water supply, such as 
System Acceptability  a well, this condition must be marked.  For proposed 
construction cases, acceptance of an individual sewage 
system must be required.  Acceptance of the sewage 
system is also required for existing or new 
construction cases in which there is an indication of a 
problem or the property is in an area known to have 
soil percolation problems. Certifications are valid for 
90 days unless the local authority indicates otherwise.

Dear [Mr. or Ms.]  [Veteran’s last name]: 
 
The above property has been appraised by a fee appraiser assigned by the VA Regional Loan Center in [ 
RLC City and State]. On [date NOV issued], the VA-authorized appraisal reviewer personally reviewed the fee 
appraiser's report and determined the property's estimated reasonable value to be $[ value ]. The maximum 
repayment period for a loan secured by this property is [30 years or estimated remaining economic life on 
appraisal, whichever is less].   
   
The VA appraisal was made to determine the reasonable value of the property for loan purposes. 
The appraisal must not be considered a building inspection. Neither VA nor the lender can guarantee that 
the home will be satisfactory to you in all respects or that all equipment will operate properly. A thorough 
inspection of the property by you or a reputable inspection firm may help minimize any problems that 
could arise after loan closing. In an existing home, particular attention should be given to plumbing, 
heating, electrical and roofing components. VA recommends testing for radon, which the government has 
determined can cause lung cancer.   
   
REMEMBER: VA GUARANTEES THE LOAN, NOT THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY

 VA Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs) per Chapter 12. 
  
Consequences  A lender may close a loan based on a “clear” final inspection report. 
of Inspections   
Deviations from the construction exhibits may necessitate revision of the VA 
value estimate, if appropriate. 
 
Properties that fail to meet VA MPRs will not be acceptable as the security 
for a VA loan. 
   
Determining  Use the table below to determine the type of inspection required.

a. Purpose of  The purpose of the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) is to 
LAPP  speed up the time to loan closing by allowing VA-authorized lenders to 
receive appraisal reports directly from appraisers and process them 
without VA involvement. 
  
b. How LAPP  There are basically four steps in processing LAPP cases. 
Works 
 
Stage  Description 
1  The LAPP lender requests VA assignment of a fee appraiser 
and a VA loan number (same as any other case) and identifies 
the case as “LAPP.” 
2  The VA-assigned appraiser sends the appraisal report directly 
to the LAPP lender’s VA-approved staff appraisal reviewer 
(SAR). 
3  The LAPP lender’s SAR 
 
 reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques as 
well as other VA requirements, 
 determines the reasonable value of the property and any 
conditions which must be met prior to VA guaranty of the 
loan, and 
 sends the veteran buyer a written notice of the value which 
includes any conditions or requirements upon which the VA 
loan guaranty is contingent. 
4  The LAPP lender then underwrites and closes the loan on the 
automatic basis and requests VA guaranty.

production operation. 
 
Upon request, the lender must agree to furnish VA with findings and 
information about the system.  The senior officer must certify on each SAR’s 
Lender's Staff Appraisal Reviewer Application (SAR) Application, VA Form 
26-0785, that the QC system meets the requirements detailed in this section.

Common Interest Communities 
  
Introduction  While only condominiums must be approved by VA, lots or units securing VA loans  
in condominiums and other planned unit developments must meet both title and lien-related VA 
regulatory requirements.  The lender is responsible for ensuring that these requirements are met for 
each VA loan.  Although there is no specific VA requirement that lenders maintain evidence in the 
loan file that these requirements are met, they may wish to be guided by the advice of their legal 
counsel in this regard. 
 
Acceptable  The title requirements for every VA loan, whether or not the property is located in a common 
Title  interest communities, are stated in VA regulations 
(38 CFR 36.4350).  These requirements indicate 
 
 the estate must not be less than fee simple, except under certain circumstances (38 CFR 
36.4350(a)) 
 title must to be subject to unreasonable restrictions o use and occupancy, except under 
certain circumstances (38 CFR 36.4350(b)), and 
 certain minor title limitations will not be considered by VA, to the extent described, as 
materially affecting the value of the property 
 (38 CFR 36.4350 (c)).

Superior VA  VA regulations require that every VA loan be secured by a first lien on the property, except 
Lien  under certain circumstances.  (38 CFR 36.4351 and 38 CFR 36.4352) 
 
When a property is located in a condominium or planned unit development, the lender must 
ensure that any mandatory homeowner association assessment is subordinate to the VA-
guaranteed mortgage.

How to  HUD/USDA Approval 
Expedite VA  Generally, projects already approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
Approval  (HUD) or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) do not need further VA 
review.  Upon receipt of evidence of HUD/USDA approval, such as a copy of the 
HUD/USDA approved project list or the project approval letter, the VA office of jurisdiction 
adds the project to the nationwide VA list without issuing a formal VA approval letter. 
 
In rare cases, HUD or USDA may approve a project that VA discovers does not comply with 
VA regulations.  In those cases, VA notifies the lender as soon as practicable that it will not 
guarantee loans in the project. 
 
Use of Attorney’s Opinion 
This is a highly recommended options for condominiums that have not been approved by 
HUD or USDA. 
 
Reference:  See Section 16-B. 
 
Use of Previously Approved Documents 
When the organizational documents being submitted are essentially the same as a set 
previously approved by VA, the lender/sponsor should include a certification from the 
declarant or declarant’s attorney which 
 
 states the fact 
 specifically identifies the previous set, and 
 describes any variation to the previous set. 
 
State Agency Certification of a Condominium 
If a state agency certifies that the condominium has been created in compliance with the laws 
of the state in which it is located, include the certification.

7.  Grants each owner a non-exclusive easement of use and enjoyment in the common areas which is appurtenant 
to and passes with title to each unit.  Each owner also has a non-exclusive easement for egress and ingress over 
the common areas, to the extent necessary to provide access to the unit and for utilities serving that unit.  The 
right of access for necessary ingress and egress to the unit and utility services cannot be suspended by the board

e.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors,  without member, mortgagee and agency

or extraordinary uses of the common areas; 
 
f.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors, without member, mortgagee or agency 
approvals unless otherwise provided in the declaration, and consistent with existing local jurisdiction’s zoning 
and subdivision ordinances, to transfer part of the common areas for the purpose of adjusting lot lines in 
accordance with reasonably stated provisions (i.e., does not reduce total open space area below zoning 
requirements, does not materially affect development plan on file with an agency, and all units previously 
adjacent to common areas - remain so located, unless the owners of the units approve the boundary line 
adjustment); 
 
g.  Right of the board of directors without member, mortgagee or agency approvals unless otherwise provided in 
the declaration, to suspend the right of any member, and the rights of such member's household, tenants, guests 
and invitees to use recreational facilities or other common areas (to the extent that access and utility service are 
not impaired) for a period not to exceed 60 days, unless such rights are suspended for failure to pay 
assessments, in which case such rights may be suspended until the assessments are fully paid; or 
 
h.  Special declarant rights reserved by the declarant, (i) such as: right to use portions of the common areas for 
sales and marketing purposes; (ii) reservation of easements across the common areas for development purposes; 
(iii) right to grant, terminate or vacate easements across common areas for limited purposes such as installation 
and maintenance of utilities, storm water management or provision of services to units. 
 
8.  Contains provisions for maintaining the common areas.  If the association maintains areas it does not own (such 
as within a public right-of way for landscaping or signage or storm water management), the attorney must 
provide an explanation which describes the arrangement and discusses the rationale.

9.  Contains provisions for the adoption of an annual operating budget and imposition and collection of 
assessments to meet the expenses of the association.  The board of directors has the power on behalf of the 
association to levy both annual and additional assessments.  
 
a.  Units of a similar nature, receiving similar services, are assessed on a uniform basis except for the reduced 
assessment permitted for unoccupied units owned by the declarant or a builder.  If a different basis is used 
which allocates assessment liability among unit based on different services provided to the units or the different 
nature of the units, the rationale for that basis must be fully explained. 
 
b.  If the declarant furnishes a multi-year feasibility budget, the declarant and/or a builder may pay a reduced 
annual assessment on unoccupied lots only provided that such reduced assessment is not less than 25% of the 
full annual assessment.  Alternatively, the declarant or builder may pay a one-time assessment equal to 25 
percent of the applicable annual assessment per lot based upon the first year budget at maximum build-out (or 5 
years out for projects involving 250 or more lots/units).  The lots for which the one-time assessment has been 
paid may be exempt from further assessment until the earlier of: (i) initial occupancy or (ii) two fiscal years 
after submission to the declaration.  If unoccupied units are receiving the benefit of the reduced or one-time 
assessment, the documents provide that the declarant, or builder(s) as appropriate, must provide for or pay for 
all maintenance to such units and shall fund all operating budget deficits incurred during the declarant control 
period, including reserves based upon expected lives of items for which reserved, but not including shortfalls 
caused by nonpayment of assessments by other members or extraordinary expenditures (e.g., expenses caused 
by natural catastrophes or environmental hazards).  A unit initially occupied or conveyed to a unit owner other 
than the declarant or a builder is fully assessed.  The obligation to fund budget deficits is a lien against all the 
land owned by the declarant (or the declarant and builders) in the planned unit development.

10. If a maximum annual assessment is stated, the maximum may increase automatically by the greater of ten 
percent or based upon a Consumer Price Index, such as the U.S. Department of Urban Price Index - All Urban 
Consumers (1982-84=100) or other comparable index reflecting the association’s cost increase experience each 
year.  The maximum may also be increased by a majority vote of the members obligated to pay such assessment 
or with the written approval of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number of authorized votes of 
members obligated to pay such assessment (in both cases excluding the declarant during the declarant control 
period).  Increases in certain fixed costs for insurance, taxes, recycling or waste disposal may be passed through 
to the members, by permitting an automatic increase in the maximum assessment which reflects those increases.  
If no maximum assessment is set forth, a vote of the members must be required to approve capital expenditures, 
other than for repair and replacement, during a fiscal year of more than 20 percent of the budget for common 
expenses for that fiscal year. 
 
11. Contains provisions for a lien-supported assessment.  The assessment lien of any assessment levied by the 
association is subordinate to the lien of a first mortgage (Title 38, USC, section 3703(d)(3)).  Subordination to 
other security interests or liens is acceptable if permitted by applicable law.  The sale or transfer of any unit 
pursuant to mortgage foreclosure of a first mortgage or any proceeding in lieu thereof extinguishes the lien of 
such assessments as to payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer.  No sale or transfer relieves 
such unit from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.  (NOTE: VA will 
not recognize any limited priority that common expense assessments may have over the first mortgage lien.  
Mortgage holders should be aware that no VA claim payment will be made to holders for any payments they 
may have made to clear prior liens for delinquent and unpaid association assessments).

12. Contains provisions for collection of assessments.  The interest rate permitted to be charged by the association 
is uniform, reasonable and non-usurious.  The method of determining the interest rate is set forth.  A rate not to 
exceed that charged by the Internal Revenue Service on delinquent taxes is considered reasonable.  The 
association has the power both to foreclose the association's lien and to bring a legal action against the member 
personally obligated to pay the assessment.  The documents may provide that a successor in title is entitled to 
obtain an association disclosure statement or estoppel certificate with respect to common expense assessments, 
in which case an owner's personal obligation to pay assessments is assumed by successors in title unless the 
successor in title acquired title through foreclosure, or any proceeding in lieu thereof, of a first mortgage.  
(NOTE: Units which will be subject to a VA-guaranteed loan will not be subject to delinquent assessments in 
excess of 6 months in any case in which the association has not brought enforcement action against the current 
unit owner.) 
 
13. Contains provisions for enforcement of the association documents.  If owners are held liable for costs and 
expenses incurred by the association as a result of acts or omissions of such owner or such owner’s tenants, 
agents, employees, invitees, guests and household members in failing to comply with the association documents 
or rules or regulations of the association, regardless of negligence or culpability,  then the Public Offering 
Statement and or Information Brochure must describe this matter. 
 
14. Contains provisions requiring appropriate types of insurance.  The board of directors, on behalf of the 
association, has the authority to and is required to obtain coverages in the areas of property damage, liability, 
and personnel.  Owners may be required to maintain certain types of insurance coverages and, if the owner fails 
to purchase that insurance, the board may obtain those coverages at the owner’s expense.  All hazard and flood 
insurance policies which include any units, must also have the standard mortgagee clause and provide for notice 
to the mortgagee at least ten days before lapse, material modification or cancellation of the policy. 
 
15. Contains provisions for reconstruction of the common areas after condemnation or casualty loss.

the common areas: (i) the association documents must:  (a) permanently assign a parking space on the common 
area to each unit; (b) assign a specific parking area to a specific group of units or (c) make other provisions 
assuring parking in compliance with local ordinances; or (ii) the declarant must provide other evidence of 
parking in compliance with local ordinances. 
 
17. Contains provisions guaranteeing mortgagees (may be limited to eligible mortgagees, as defined below) and 
agencies notice of amendments.  During the declarant control period: (i) the declarant must provide a copy of all 
amendments to VA; and (ii) the association may not make any material amendments or take any extraordinary 
actions as described in subparagraph 6 above without the approval of VA.  The declaration may provide that 
certain rights and protections (including notice and approval rights) are granted to only those mortgagees who 
have provided notice to the board of directors of their interest and requested all rights under the association 
documents “eligible mortgagees.”  Rights granted to eligible mortgagees should include the following: 
 
a.  Right to inspect association documents and records on the same terms as the members; 
 
b.  Notice of all material amendments to the association documents; 
 
c.  Notice of any extraordinary actions of the association; 
 
d.  Notice of any property loss, condemnation or eminent domain proceeding affecting the common areas 
resulting in losses greater than 10 percent of the annual budget or any unit insured by the association in which 
the mortgagee has an interest; 
 
e.  Notice of any termination, lapse or material modification of an insurance policy held by the association; 
 
f.  Notice of any default by an owner of a unit subject to a mortgage held by the eligible mortgagee in paying 
assessments or charges to the association which remains uncured for sixty consecutive days;

i.  Right of a majority of the eligible mortgagees to demand an audit of the association's financial records. 
 
18. Contains provisions for party walls, if a townhouse planned community.  The association documents or law of 
the jurisdiction must provide for the maintenance, repair and reconstruction of party walls and allocate the costs 
among the owners served by a party wall. 
 
19. Contains provisions for expansion or annexation in a phased development.  The declaration must, in addition to 
submitting at least 1 phase to the covenants and restrictions: (i) describe the additional land proposed to be 
submitted in the future in a sufficient manner to locate the property; (ii) grant the declarant the right to submit 
the described additional land; (iii) describe the method of submitting additional land; d describe the basis of 
voting rights and assessment obligations of units added in relation to the voting rights and assessment 
obligations of units already subject to the declaration or provide that such rights for future phases will be the 
same as for phases already submitted; and establish a reasonable time limit for submitting additional land.  A 
reasonable time limit will depend on the size of the development, but generally annexation made within the later 
of 7 years after recordation of the Declaration or 5 years after the most recent recordation of an annexation 
document is considered reasonable.  The additional land must be contiguous, adjacent or across a public right-
of-way.  If the additional land is not so located, there must be a clear statement of that fact and a discussion of 
the rationale for its potential inclusion.  The declaration may reserve the right to the declarant to submit a 
limited amount of undescribed adjacent additional land, increasing the total size of the planned community by 
up to 10 percent both in land size and number of additional units, or such undescribed additional land may be 
added by the association with a majority vote of the members at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is 
present or the written consent of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number of votes, in both cases 
excluding the votes of the declarant during the declarant control period.

Chapter 17 
VA Sanctions Against Program Participants 
Overview 
 
Introduction  VA is authorized to impose sanctions against persons or entities who take 
actions which are detrimental to the VA loan guaranty program.  The type and 
severity of the sanction imposed is based on 
 
 the type of participant (for example, lender, builder, management broker, 
etc.), and 
 the nature of the actions (for example., fraud, significant deficiencies in 
performance, ongoing disregard for VA requirements, and so on). 
 
Sanctions may be imposed in the form of 
 
 civil money penalties, and/or 
 the participant’s full or partial exclusion from participation in the VA loan 
guaranty program for a certain period of time. 
 
Appeal Rights  VA provides appeal rights to all program participants against whom sanctions 
are imposed.  The notice informing the participant that sanctions will be or 
are imposed explains what the participant must do to appeal VA’s decision. 
 
In this Chapter  This chapter contains the following topics.

17.07  Unfair Contract Provisions or Marketing Practices, 
Continued 
 
Unfair  Unfair marketing practices include, but are not limited to 
Marketing   
Practices   enforcement of unfair contractual provisions 
 requiring purchasers to execute so-called “contracts” which legally bind the 
purchasers but do not bind the seller to deliver the property when completed 
to the purchasers 
 
Example:  limiting a seller’s liability to the refund of the earnest money 
deposit 
 
 advertising that a property or project is “VA guaranteed” or “VA approved” 
or “VA inspected” in such a way as to lead veterans to believe that VA 
guarantees the construction and workmanship 
Note:  “VA financing available,” “Eligible for VA financing,” or similar 
advertising is acceptable. 
 
 delaying tactics on the part of the builder to postpone completion of the 
property or the closing of the sale after completion in an effort to induce the 
veteran to agree to a modification of a firm contract such as 
 the substitution of inferior materials 
 the omission of appliances, or 
 an increase in price. 
 
 failure of the seller or agent of the seller of proposed or newly constructed 
property to place deposits or downpayments received from veteran-
purchasers in a special trust account , as required by 38 U.S.C. 3706 
 failure to place downpayments or earnest money deposits in a trust fund 
or in escrow when required by law or by local practice on existing 
properties, or 
 failure or inability of the seller to return the deposit when and if required 
under the contract when it is not required or not customary for these 
deposits to be “isolated,” and 
[38 U.S.C. 3706] 
 
 failure of the seller of proposed or newly constructed property to state in the 
sales agreement, when applicable, that the property was or will be 
constructed under FHA compliance inspection procedures pursuant to 
section 203(i) or 221(d)(2) of the National Housing Act.

Chapter 18:  Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) 
 
1.  Purpose and Eligibility Requirements 
 
a. Purpose of  Servicers of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guaranteed loans may be 
SAPP  granted authority, under Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP), to 
review liquidation appraisals, and issue the Notice of Value (NOV) without 
VA involvement.  The servicer exercises its SAPP authority through an 
employee who is VA-approved as a SAPP Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR).  
Once a SAR has satisfied the SAPP training and initial case review 
requirements (see section 3 of this chapter), their SAPP authority may be used 
for eligible properties (those secured by VA-guaranteed loans) in any location 
within the United States and its territories.  The purpose of SAPP is to reduce 
the time required for servicers of VA loans to receive the NOV.  
 
Important:  It is the SAR’s responsibility to stay informed about any local 
VA processing requirements unique to the VA jurisdiction in which a 
property is located. 
 
b. Servicer  To be granted SAPP authority, the servicer must have:  
Eligibility   
Requirements 
 a VA servicer identification number (ID), 
 an association with a single lender having a VA lender ID, and 
 an effective quality control (QC) system that ensures the adequacy and 
quality of its SARs.  (See section 6 of this chapter.) 
 
Note:  Under SAPP, a servicer may only have an association with a single 
lender. 
 
c. SAR  The servicer exercises its SAPP authority through an employee who is a VA-
Eligibility  approved SAR.  A SAR must: 
Requirements   
 be a full-time salaried employee of the lender/servicer, and  
 have at least three years of work experience that qualifies him or her to 
competently perform administrative appraisal reviews.

VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised  
Chapter 18:  Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) 
1.  Purpose and Eligibility Requirements, 
Continued 
  
c. SAR  The SAR’s work experience must indicate that he or she has: 
Eligibility   
Requirements 
 general knowledge of the principles, methods, practices, and techniques of 
(continued) 
appraising and the ability to apply that knowledge, 
 the ability to review the work of others and recognize deviations from 
accepted appraisal principles and practices, 
 the ability to detect errors in computations, and 
 the ability to detect conclusions that are not supported. 
 
It is also desirable for the SAR to have knowledge of general realty practices 
and principles related to real property valuation, skill in collecting and 
assembling data, and the ability to prepare clear and concise reports. 
 
Note:  Three years experience related to the Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) Direct Endorsement (DE) program satisfies the experience 
requirement, provided all other application requirements are satisfied. 
 
d. SAR  There must be no conflict of interest between the SAR’s role and any other 
Conflicts of  activities that he or she conducts.  Examples of other activities that would 
Interest  constitute a conflict of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 
 the SAR being on the VA fee appraisal panel, or 
 the SAR being employed by or performing appraisal review services for 
another lender/servicer.

2.  Applying for Authority 
  
a. Application  The nominating senior officer of the servicer and the nominee must jointly 
and Fees  complete the Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) application. 
 
SAR applicants must attach a resume showing they possess the three years 
requisite experience outlined in section 1 of this chapter. 
 
A $100 processing fee must accompany the application package.   
  
b. Notification  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Central Office will review the 
of VA Decision  application and send a letter of preliminary approval or rejection.  In some 
cases, VA will need to request additional information from both the nominee 
and the senior officer in order to make a determination. 
 
Receipt of a letter of preliminary approval will authorize the nominee to 
schedule Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SAR training.  
  
c. SAR ID  VA will issue a permanent identification (ID) number for each SAR 
Number  approved.  The SAR always retains the same ID number, even when 
employed by a different servicer.   
 
When a SAR already has a Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) 
SAR ID number, the number will also be used as the SAPP SAR ID. 
 
d. SAR  If a SAR begins work for a new servicer, the SAR’s SAPP authority 
Employed By  automatically ceases and does not transfer to the new servicer.  To reinstate 
New Servicer  the SAR’s SAPP authority, the new servicer employer must promptly submit 
to VA: 
 
 a new SAPP application, and 
 a $100 processing fee. 
 
The servicer may request a waiver for the training and case review 
requirements for that SAR by including: 
 
 the SAR’s VA-issued ID number on the application, and  
 a statement that the SAR has processed SAPP cases within the last year.

3.  Training and Initial Test Case Reviews   
  
a. Requirements  Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SARs) with preliminary approval may not 
independently review liquidation appraisal reports and issue liquidation 
Notice of Values (NOVs), without the involvement of Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA), until they receive final approval.  To obtain final 
approval, the SAR must complete the following: 
 
 attend Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SAR training, and  
 successfully complete five initial test cases to demonstrate comprehension 
of VA liquidation appraisal review requirements to VA’s satisfaction. 
 
VA Central Office staff will provide SAPP SAR training at the request of the 
servicer and VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) staff will conduct the initial 
test case reviews.   
 
b. Test Case  Upon completion of SAR training, SARs may begin submitting their test 
Procedures  cases in The Appraisal System (TAS) for VA review.  Only one test case 
should be pending at any time; SARs should not submit an additional test 
case until the results of a previously submitted test case are known.  RLC 
staff will notify the SAR about the results of the review.  The RLC staff 
performing the review of test cases must complete the liquidation appraisal 
review and issue the NOV within five workdays from the date the case is 
submitted by the SAR.   
 
The following table outlines the steps for processing SAPP SAR test cases.  
Please note that these are the same steps for processing any SAPP cases, 
except for the requirement of VA involvement. 
 
Step  Description 
1  SAR accesses the VA E-Appraisal application in the Veterans 
Information Portal (VIP or Portal) and retrieves a SAPP appraisal.  
(Only SAPP appraisals associated with the SAR’s company may 
be retrieved.) 
2  SAR reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques, and for 
compliance with applicable VA directives and general and 
liquidation appraisal requirements in chapter 11. 
 
The SAR must resolve any concerns with the appraiser. (Report 
any contact with the appraiser and the results in “Processing 
Notes” when issuing the NOV.)

b. Test Case Procedures (continued) 
  
Step  Description 
3  SAR determines the as-is value of the property, which must be 
supported by the reviewed appraisal report. (Make entries in 
“Processing Notes” to clarify or justify actions that are not self-
explanatory.) 
4  SAR accesses TAS in VIP, selects “Issue Liquidation NOV,” and 
inputs the required data to generate an NOV.  (TAS will not allow 
SARs with preliminary approval to issue NOVs; they may only be 
saved as NOV test cases awaiting review by the RLC.  (Upon 
receipt of SAR final approval, TAS will allow issuance of the 
NOV without VA involvement.) 
 
Note: The SAR must notify the RLC of jurisdiction when a test 
case has been submitted in TAS. 
5  VA RLC staff will review the following for all test cases and a 
percentage of subsequent cases:  
 
 appraisal report, 
 any related documents, 
 the saved test case NOV, and  
 processing notes, for any contacts with the appraiser, processing 
delays and clarification and/or justification of processing actions.  
6  VA staff will issue the NOV.  The SAR will be notified of the 
result(s) of the VA test case review and the SAR’s performance 
file will be documented. 
 
c. Continuing  As needed, VA will notify SAPP SARs of supplemental training 
Education by  opportunities or additional training requirements.

4.  Servicer Responsibilities 
  
a. SAPP  Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) authority is a privilege 
Privilege  delegated to servicers at VA’s discretion.  Servicers maintain this privilege by 
complying with all applicable SAPP-related requirements, including: 
 
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policies and procedures, 
 VA regulations, and 
 statutory requirements. 
 
Furthermore, servicers are expected to exercise due diligence in processing 
SAPP cases.  VA considers due diligence to be care that is properly expected 
from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent servicer that is 
entirely dependent on the subject property as a security to protect its 
investment.  
 
If VA finds proper cause, the privilege extended to servicers under SAPP may 
be: 
 
 amended, 
 suspended, or 
 withdrawn. 
 
Reference:  For more information, refer to chapter 17. 
 
b. Servicer and  The servicer must notify VA Central Office if: 
SAR Changes   
 there is a change in ownership, merger, or acquisition, or 
 a SAR is no longer employed or is no longer functioning as a SAR for the 
servicer.  (In such cases, the SAR’s SAPP authority automatically ceases 
and the servicer’s eligibility to participate in SAPP is terminated if that 
individual was the servicer’s only SAR on staff.)

5.  Processing Procedures 
 
a. Property  The subject property must be secured by a Department of Veterans Affairs 
Eligibility  (VA) guaranteed loan that is proceeding toward liquidation. 
 
b. Appraisal  Servicers will request the appraisal in The Appraisal System (TAS) by 
Request  completing VA Form 26-1805, VA Request for Determination of Reasonable 
Value.  TAS will automatically notify the assigned appraiser via e-mail when 
the liquidation appraisal assignment is made.   
 
Servicers may authorize parties to order appraisals on their behalf (i.e., law 
firms).  Those parties must register in the Veterans Information Portal (VIP) 
under their own name as an “Other Requestor.”

Note:  When making the request, be sure to provide accurate information on 
the location of the keys to a vacant property in item 24 of VA Form 26-1805, 
VA Request for Determination of Reasonable Value, as well as the telephone 
number of the party requesting the liquidation appraisal in item 40.  This may 
require additional instructions from servicers when referring cases to 
foreclosing attorneys, if the attorneys are the parties ordering the liquidation 
appraisals.

Continued 
 
c. Access to  VA requires fee appraisers to gain access to vacant properties when 
Property by  performing VA liquidation appraisals in order to determine accurate values.  
Appraiser  If the fee appraiser is unable to gain access to a vacant property, the appraiser 
should use the contact information provided in item 40 of VA Form 26-1805, 
VA Request for Determination of Reasonable Value.  Servicers’ timely 
responses to any telephone inquiries help to limit delays in completion of 
appraisals for those cases where an appraiser encounters problems accessing 
the vacant property. 
 
If the appraiser still cannot gain access, he or she must document the actions 
taken to obtain access to the subject vacant property in an e-mail to the 
Construction & Valuation (C&V) section of jurisdiction.  C&V will then 
forward the appraiser’s email to the Regional Loan Center’s Loan 
Administration Officer, who will forward it to the appropriate servicer 
personnel.   
 
Time delays caused by an appraiser’s inability to access a property can result 
in postponed liquidation sales.  Because such delays are beyond the control of 
the appraiser, C&V “stops the clock” on the appraiser’s timeliness 
requirements until access is obtained.  However, in most cases, VA does not 
view delays as beyond the control of the servicer, and therefore the servicer 
may suffer curtailment of interest on the loan if a sale cannot be completed 
timely due to delays in the appraiser obtaining access to a property. 
 
d. Liquidation  For details about VA liquidation appraisal requirements, see section 13 of 
Appraisal  chapter 11. 
Requirements 
 
e. Submitting  If a SAR is reluctant to issue the Notice of Value (NOV) due to the difficulty 
Cases to VA for  or complexity of the case, the SAR may request that the VA Regional Loan 
Processing  Center (RLC) of jurisdiction issue the NOV.

2.  Misleading Advertisements 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 
a. Policy  The Department of Veterans Affairs always strives to provide all veterans the 
most up-to-date and pertinent information about their benefits.  Toward that 
end, all appropriate efforts by lenders to further educate or remind veterans 
about their home loan benefit and the lender’s availability to assist the veteran 
in obtaining the benefit is appreciated.  However, it is inappropriate to direct 
any information about benefits to veterans which is in any way misleading. 
 
It must be clearly understood that VA has a very specific mission to serve 
veterans, who are declared by Congress to be a “special class of citizen,” and 
veterans rely on VA to provide dependable service and reliable information 
concerning their benefits.   
 
Any action on the part of lenders or other program participants which 
jeopardizes VA’s credibility with veterans or induces veterans to obtain loans 
which are clearly not in their best interests would be viewed by VA as actions 
which are detrimental to the best interests of veterans.  If such a determination 
is made, grounds for suspension from participation in the VA Loan Guaranty 
Program could be established. 
 
b. Examples  Example 1: 
 
In increasing numbers, VA has been receiving inquiries and complaints from 
veterans concerning advertisements and solicitations they have received from 
lenders which state that VA has a new program to refinance their VA loan 
and lower their interest rate, an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan 
(IRRRL).   
 
The IRRRL program has been available to veterans since the enactment of 
The Veterans’ Disability Compensation and Housing Benefits Amendments 
of 1980 (Public Law 96-385).   
 
In addition, many of these solicitations suggest that the lender has some 
special relationship with VA that enables only them to offer this loan 
opportunity.  Some even clearly attempts to give the impression that the 
“letter” the veteran received came from VA.

2.  Misleading Advertisements, 
Continued 
  
b. Examples  Example 2: 
(continued)  Another unacceptable advertising approach that some lenders have been using 
is to invite veterans to “skip” payments and refinance their loan.  It generally 
gives the appearance that VA condones skipping payments and rolling them 
into the new IRRRL. This is not the case. 
   
It is irresponsible to suggest to any mortgagor that this program encourages 
skipping payments, or that this is an appropriate means of getting around the 
prohibition against receiving cash from the transaction.   
 
Any advertising that promotes skipping payments as a means of obtaining 
cash for other purposes is unacceptable. 
 
c. Lender  VA encourages all lenders to continue offering VA financing to all eligible 
Responsibility  and qualified veterans, and it is recognized that mortgage lending is a 
competitive industry.  However, VA insists that lenders refrain from any and 
all practices which might mislead veterans into actions which are contrary to 
their own best interests.   
 
If your firm has been engaging in such advertising, or is considering doing so, 
VA strongly recommends that anything in your promotional material which is 
in any way inaccurate or misleading be deleted.  If there is uncertainty about 
the accuracy or propriety of the advertisement or solicitation, please consult 
with the appropriate local VA office or the Loan Policy staff at VA Central 
Office at (202) 273-7368. 
 
d. Sanctions  Sanctions of program participants for violations of regulations are set forth in 
38 CFR part 44.   Refer to Chapter 17 for additional information on sanctions 
of program participants.

3.  Automated Underwriting 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
 This section has been changed to create subsection lettering. 
 Subsection a has been changed to add a reference to the Zippy program. 
 Subsection c’s reference to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s automated 
underwriting systems has been changed to “provider of these systems.”  
This change is due to the increase in the number of approved systems. 
 
a. General  VA has approved the use of several automated underwriting systems.  The 
systems are 
 
 Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, 
 Fannie Mae’s DU, 
 Countrywide’s CLUES System, and 
 Chase’s Zippy 
 
Note:  The Chase and Countrywide systems may only be used in connection 
with their loans.  
 
The systems are only for use by VA automatic lenders, and only on loans 
eligible for automatic processing.   
 
These systems assign a risk classification which determines the level of 
underwriting and documentation needed. 
 
b. Lender  The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely 
Responsibility  determine a risk classification.  It is still the lender’s decision whether or not 
to approve the loan.   
 
Lenders are still responsible for meeting all VA requirements for all loans; 
however they may take advantage of certain documentation waivers based on 
the risk classification. 
 
c. VA’s Role  Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor. 
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these systems.

4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 
a.  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, 
Compatibility  many lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate 
of VA Program  measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to 
with HMDA 
home mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be 
aware of how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in 
meeting this goal. 
 
The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for 
individuals with low-to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such applicants.  The “VA Credit Standards” are written as guidelines and 
are meant to be interpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration 
all of an individual loan applicant’s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.   
 
This topic provides guidance on areas of underwriting that may be of 
particular concern when processing applications for low-to-moderate income 
borrowers.  Many of the concepts are discussed in Chapter 4, Credit 
Underwriting, but are repeated here to emphasize their importance and 
applicability to underwriting loans to minority and low-to-moderate income 
applicants. 
 
b. Purpose  This topic in the “VA Lender's Handbook” is intended to encourage 
underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be 
approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of the credit 
standards.  The examples discussed are certainly not all inclusive, but they 
should help the underwriter recognize that there are those whose lifestyle, 
minority status, or location require consideration of extraordinary, yet valid, 
factors in the underwriting process in order to find a basis for correctly 
making an approval decision. 
 
Underwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications 
for every qualified veteran.

c. Use of VA  Although lenders that have automatic authority should use that authority to 
Prior Approval  the maximum extent possible, another important tool available to lenders 
Procedure  seeking to increase credit access by minority and lower income borrowers is 
the optional use of VA’s prior-approval processing.   
 
Loan applications that may not be clearly approvable under VA’s published 
credit standards but which, in the lender’s view, contain compensating 
strengths, may be sent to VA on the prior-approval basis.  Lenders should 
submit an explanation as to why the loan was not closed automatically and 
point out the reasons why they believe the loan may be approvable. 
 
d. Employment  A borrower’s employment and income stability are vital to the underwriting 
and Income  of a loan.  There are characteristics that should be considered when 
Stability  underwriting loans for low-to-moderate income borrowers when evaluating 
acceptable employment and income. 
 
Changing of Jobs 
It is possible to establish stable and reliable income without having 
established a stable employment history in one position or job.  It is not 
unusual for some borrowers to change jobs frequently, even changing lines of 
work.  The borrower may be simply going where there is available work.  To 
establish stability and continuance of income, the borrower must demonstrate 
the ability to maintain an income at a constant level over the recent 2-year 
period even if he or she has worked for a variety of employers. 
 
Part-Time Employment 
It is not uncommon for people with limited income from their primary 
employment to take on part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  Ideally 
the borrower should show a two-year history, but one year may be considered

unemployment compensation has been received during those periods.  If the 
applicant has a history of such an income pattern, unemployment

Factors  applicant’s qualification for a VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
 A veteran who has maintained an excellent credit history, (such as 
satisfactory payment of a shelter expense comparable to the proposed 
shelter expense) may be approvable in spite of shortfall in the residual 
income.  In such an instance, it might be appropriate to consider that the 
veteran has established a lifestyle which is substantially different from the 
average used in establishing the residual income tables in the credit 
standards. 
 A veteran with a good credit record who meets the residual income 
guideline (without exceeding it by 20 percent) may be approvable in spite 
of a high debt-to-income ratio if the proposed shelter expense is not 
significantly greater than the amount the veteran has been accustomed to 
paying.

Factors  provided in the credit standards.   
 
A compensating factor that has come into play quite recently is the numerous 
financial and homeownership counseling programs being provided by a 
variety of sources including banks, mortgage lenders, and community groups.  
These counseling programs are designed to help applicants work out payment 
plans for old debts, design savings plans, and teach basic budgeting skills.  
Programs often include homebuyer education lessons and post-closing 
counseling to assist the new homeowners once the loan is made.  Participation 
by an applicant in such a counseling program can be viewed as a strong 
compensating factor for a case in which it is otherwise difficult to conclude 
that a borrower is qualified under a traditional interpretation of the credit 
standards.

Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
 This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 Subsection a has been created by combining the two previous subsections 
into one.  This new subsection encourages lenders to use their automatic 
authority in every possible instance before submitting a loan to VA for 
underwriting. 
 
a. Use of Prior  Lenders with automatic authority must use their automatic authority in every

Automatic 
 
Lenders 
Except for cases specifically precluded from automatic processing, such as 
joint loans, the only cases lenders should consider submitting to VA for prior 
approval are those in which the underwriter firmly believes approval can be 
justified.  However, the specific facts of the case appear to preclude approval.  
In such instances, the underwriter must include: 
 
 a detailed explanation of why the loan should be approved by VA, plus 
 a thorough justification for not approving the loan on the automatic basis.   
 
It will not be sufficient to justify submitting the loan to VA solely to comply 
with the veteran’s or the real estate agent’s request to do so.

loans that must be submitted to VA for prior approval by all lenders. 
 
These loan types are listed in Topic 1 of this chapter under “Prior Approval.” 
 
The supervised lender must obtain VA recognition of agents it uses to make 
VA loans. See Topic 7 of this chapter for more information. 
 
If the lender uses an agent, it must submit the following to the VA office with 
jurisdiction over its home office by January 31 of each year: 
 
 a list of the VA-recognized agency relationships it wishes to renew, 
 the annual renewal fee (see Topic 10 of this chapter) for each lender agent 
that acts for the lender and had been recognized by VA as the lender’s agent 
as of September 30 (120 days before payment is due), and 
 any other information requested by VA. 
 
Although VA offices may issue an annual reminder notice to lenders that the 
above information is due, lenders bear the ultimate responsibility for timely 
submission of the information and appropriate fees.  Failure to pay annual 
renewal fees could result in loss of a lender’s automatic processing authority.

The extent of the relationship between the lender and the agent is at the

 The lender must accept full responsibility for the acts, errors, or omissions 
of the agent in processing and/or closing loans. 
 The lender accepts this responsibility by certification on VA Form 26-1820, 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement, and the corporate 
resolution. 
 The lender may not subsequently claim that it should not be held 
accountable for inaccurate or fraudulent credit information or other loan 
data because it relied on the agent. 
 Irregularities resulting from acts or omissions of the agent are treated as acts 
or omissions of the lender. 
 The lender’s use of an agent will not prevent VA from taking actions in 
appropriate cases such as denial of liability, claim adjustments, collection of 
the amount of any loss incurred due to irregularities, and imposition of 
sanctions against both the lender and the agent. 
 
If the lender is a non-supervised automatic lender, loans made by an agent on 
its behalf which are closed automatically must be reviewed and approved by a 
VA-approved underwriter employed by the lender.

Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. The Issue  Changes in ownership or corporate structure of a lender may impact its 
continued qualifications for automatic authority.  Lenders must notify VA 
whenever a merger, acquisition, or change in the ownership of the lender 
occurs, so that VA can evaluate any impact on the lender’s participation in the 
VA Home Loan program.  
 
Although only the terms “merger” and “acquisition” and “selling,” 
“acquiring” or “surviving” entities are used in this paragraph, the concepts 
and procedures in this paragraph apply to every type of restructuring that has 
a significant impact on an organization’s ownership, structure, or assets, and 
so on.

9.  Withdrawal of Automatic Authority from Supervised or 
Non-supervised Automatic Lenders 
   
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. General  VA can withdraw a lender’s automatic authority for proper cause, after giving 
the lender 30 days notice. This applies to both supervised and non-supervised 
lenders.  VA regulations at 38 CFR 36.4349 provide the framework.  The 
lender may continue processing loans on a prior approval basis after its 
automatic authority has been withdrawn. 
 
The remainder of this Topic gives the reasons a lender’s automatic authority 
can be withdrawn, and the corresponding period for which the withdrawal 
will be effective. 
  
b. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for an indefinite period can be based on any of the following: 
for an   
Indefinite  Failure to continue meeting basic qualifying criteria: 
Period 
 
  For supervised lenders, this includes loss of status as an entity subject 
to examination and supervision by a Federal or State regulatory 
agency. 
  For non-supervised lenders, this includes no approved underwriter, 
failure to maintain $50,000 working capital or $250,000 adjusted net 
worth, and/or failure to file the required financial statements. 
 
Any of the causes for debarment set forth in 38 CFR 44. 
 
During the probationary period for newly-approved non-supervised automatic 
lenders, automatic authority may be withdrawn for poor underwriting 
consistently careless processing, failure to provide loan files timely, or to 
provide other necessary documents as requested by VA.

requirements. 
 Closing documents show instances of improper charges to Veteran after 
the impropriety of such charges are called to lender’s attention by VA, or 
the lender refuses to refund such charges after notification by VA.

purchasing the property to be his or her home.  Instead, the Veteran intends 
to transfer title to a third party who assumes the loan shortly after closing.

13.  Calculation of Adjusted Net Worth 
  
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. Method  Net worth for VA purposes is determined by 38 C.F.R. §36.4352(b)(4)(ii). 
   
b. CPA  Adjusted net worth must be calculated by a CPA using an audited and 
Requirement  certified balance sheet from the lender’s latest financial statement, per the 
above regulation. 
  
c. Calculation  Adjusted net worth is total assets, minus total liabilities, minus the following 
unacceptable assets: 
 Any assets of the lender pledged to secure obligations of another person or 
entity. 
 Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender or related 
entities, in which the lender’s officers or stockholders have a personal 
interest, unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder.  Personal 
interest indicates a relationship between the lender and a person or entity in 
which that specified person has a financial interest in or is employed in a 
management position by the lender. 
 Any investment in related entities in which the lender’s officers or 
stockholders (or their family members) have a personal interest unrelated to 
their position as an officer or stockholder. 
 That portion of an investment in joint ventures, subsidiaries, affiliates 
and/or other related entities, which is carried at a value greater than equity, 
as adjusted (“equity, as adjusted” means the book value of the related entity 
reduced by the amount of unacceptable assets carried by the related entity). 
 All intangibles, such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, franchisee fees, 
organization costs, and so on, except unamortized servicing costs carried at 
a value established by an arm’s-length transaction and presented in 
accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles. 
 That portion of an asset not readily marketable and for which appraised 
values are very subjective carried at a value in excess of a substantially 
discounted appraised value.  Assets such as antiques, art work, and 
gemstones are subject to this provision and should be carried at the lower of 
cost or market. 
 Any asset that is principally used for the personal enjoyment of an officer or 
stockholder and not for normal business purposes.

1.  How to Establish the Applicant’s Eligibility for a VA Loan 
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
a. What is  Eligibility means the Veteran meets the basic criteria of length of service 
Eligibility  (LOS) and character of service (COS) for the home loan benefit. Entitlement 
is the amount a Veteran has available for a guaranty on a loan.  An eligible 
Veteran must still meet credit and income standards in order to qualify for a 
VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
b. The  The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) issued in WebLGY is the proof of 
Lender’s Role  eligibility for the lender. 
 
The lender must ensure the applicant is an eligible Veteran before an appraisal 
is ordered, the loan cannot be processed or closed.  Lenders should never 
close a loan before they establish eligibility. VA cannot guarantee a loan for 
an ineligible Veteran.   
 
Once a COE is issued there may be conditions on the COE which must be met 
in order to receive a guaranty.  The conditions that could appear on the COE 
are: 
 
  Active Duty Service Member (ADSM) - Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of 
continuous active duty as of date of note is required. This COE is not 
valid if the ADSM was discharged after the date of the certificate. In 
this instance, a new COE must be obtained.   
  Funding Fee – Please fax a copy of VA Form 26-8937 to the Regional 
Loan Center (RLC) of Jurisdiction.  Please have the lender contact the 
RLC for loan processing. 
  Funding Fee – Veteran is not exempt from funding fee due to non-
service connected pension.  Loan application will require prior 
approval processing by VA.  
  Reserve or National Guard Member – Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to the date of this certificate.  A certification of 
continuous service in the Selected Reserve or National Guard as of the 
date of the note is required.

continued  fee is required. 
  Refinance Restoration – Restored entitlement previously used or

that loan. 
  One-Time Restoration – Entitlement previously used for a VA LIN has 
been restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38

previously used entitlement has been restored.  The Veteran must pay a 
subsequent use funding fee on any future loan unless the Veteran is 
exempt. 
  Surviving Spouse – Eligibility of the surviving spouse and the validity 
of guaranty entitlement hereby evidenced will be null and void if any 
change in marital status occurs, subsequent to the date of this COE and 
prior to the date a loan to the widow or widower is closed, unless the 
lender making the loan was not aware of any change in marital status 
and obtained on the date the loan closed an affidavit from the surviving 
spouse in the form prescribed by the Secretary. 
  Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) – This certificate 
evidences eligibility under 38 U.S.C 3701 (b)(3) of the individual 
named as the spouse of a Servicemember missing in action or prisoner 
of war.  Any unused entitlement will terminate automatically upon the 
receipt of official notice that the Servicemember is no longer in a 
category specified in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(3) or upon dissolution of 
marriage. 
  Paid-in-Full Loan – Entitlement charged on a paid-in-full loan cannot 
be restored until the Veteran applies for restoration of entitlement.  The 
lender shall submit the application electronically through VA’s 
Automated Certificate of Eligibility (ACE) online application.

Lenders Role,  intended to provide a lender with all the knowledge necessary to make an 
continued  eligibility determination; consequently, all the various exceptions and nuances 
of eligibility are not included.  Appendix 1-A at the end of this chapter 
provides a quick reference and overview of basic eligibility criteria. 
 
Lenders must use VA’s ACE online application to obtain the COE. Go to 
VA’s Information Portal (VIP) and select WebLGY from the applications 
toolbar; then select Eligibility and follow the prompts.  In many cases, a COE 
can be generated in seconds.  If not, lenders should select the link to submit an 
electronic application.  This method allows lenders to upload supporting 
documentation and submit an application electronically to be processed by one 
of the RLCs. 
 
A Veteran can apply for a COE through eBenefits at 
http://www.ebenefits.va.gov or, if necessary, by completing VA Form 26- 
1880, Request for a Certificate of Eligibility and mailing it to the listed RLC.  
Simultaneous applications may delay COE processing. To ensure quicker 
responses, it is preferable to apply online.

Determination  loan.  This means if a lender successfully obtains a case number for an IRRRL, 
a COE is not required.

  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
   
The lender may rely on a COE as proof the Veteran is eligible for the home 
a. Eligibility 
loan benefit.  Although eligible for the home loan benefit, Veterans must still 
 
qualify based on income and credit before loan approval is granted. 
 
 
 
   
Entitlement is the amount available for use on a loan. The amount of basic 
b. Amount of 
entitlement is $36,000.  This may be reduced if a Veteran has used entitlement 
Entitlement 
before which has not been restored.  The amount of basic entitlement will be 
displayed near the center of the COE. For example it may say:    
                                                        
“THIS VETERAN’S BASIC ENTITLEMENT IS $_________ .  
TOTAL ENTITLEMENT CHARGED TO PREVIOUS VA 
LOANS IS $_______  .” 
 
For loans greater than $144,000, bonus entitlement may be available.  For 
loans greater than $144,000, but less than $484,350, the entitlement is 25 
percent.  For loans greater than $484,350, the maximum entitlement is 25 
percent of the loan limit, which can vary by county. For a list of loan limits by 
county, visit  http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/lenders.asp.  Please note 
county limits can change yearly.  VA will post the limits for each year on our 
website as they change. 
 
The Veteran may have entitlement for loans greater than 
$144,000, the COE does not reflect the bonus entitlement.  Instead, an asterisk 
by the word “available” refers to a note, which explains the possibility of 
additional entitlement. 
 
If the Veteran previously used entitlement, which has not been restored, 
available entitlement is reduced by the amount used on the prior loan(s).  The 
lender has three options in this situation: 
 
  Make the loan knowing that VA’s guaranty is limited to the amount of 
available entitlement, or 
  Have the Veteran apply for restoration of previously used entitlement, 
or 
  The Veteran may provide a downpayment in conjunction with their 
remaining entitlement.

3. How to Apply For A Certificate of Eligibility 
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019  
This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
a. Procedures  Lenders must first attempt to obtain a COE through the ACE application, 
which can be accessed through the VIP.   
 
If a COE cannot be obtained immediately, lenders should select the electronic 
application link that permits them to submit an electronic application. If the 
COE is issued with reduced entitlement and restoration is needed, use the 
“Correct COE” function to request an updated COE.   
 
The WebLGY system allows lenders to upload documentation, such as 
discharge papers or evidence to support restoration (Closing Disclosure, 
HUD-1 etc.), along with the electronic application. Lenders should not 
upload scanned documents without first completing an electronic application. 
Using this feature, rather than mail, is the preferred method, as it greatly 
reduces processing time. 
 
  Inability to obtain a COE in WebLGY does not mean the Veteran is 
ineligible, only that the system does not have sufficient information to 
make an automatic determination.  Lenders should always continue the 
application process as described in the preceding paragraph. 
  Application for an Unmarried Surviving Spouses. A surviving spouse 
of a Veteran, who dies on active duty or from service-connected 
causes, may still be eligible for a COE.  If the surviving spouse is 
remarried on or after age 57, and on or after December 16, 2003, they 
still may be eligible.  Eligibility may also be granted to the spouse of 
an active duty member who is listed as MIA or POW for at least 90 
days.  Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited to one-time 
use only.

a. Procedures,  a)  Surviving spouses of Veterans who died from non-service connected 
continued  causes may also be eligible if any of the following conditions are 
met:  (1) the Veteran was rated totally disabled for 10 years or more 
immediately preceding death; or (2) was rated totally disabled for 
not less than 5 years from date of discharge or release from active 
duty to date of death, or (3) the Veteran was a former POW who 
died after September 30, 1999, and was rated totally disabled for not 
less than 1 year immediately preceding death. The above eligibility 
requirements are determined by VA Compensation Department.  
Once completed, they will determine if the surviving spouse is 
eligible for qualifying Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC).  
b)  If applying for the first time, surviving spouses must complete VA 
Form 26-1817, Request for Determination of Loan Guaranty 
Eligibility-Unmarried Surviving Spouses, instead of VA Form 26-
1880. 
c)  Both the VA Form 26-1817 and WebLGY should be completed by 
using the name of the surviving spouse, date of birth, social security 
number, and then upload the VA Form 26-1817 in WebLGY.

  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Discharged  The DD214 Form, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty, will 
Veterans  generally contain all the information needed for VA to make an eligibility 
(Regular  determination for persons who served on active duty of the a regular 
Military)  component of the Armed Forces.  The regular Armed Forces include active 
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard.  
 
  VA will accept legible copies of the DD214 Form. 
  Veterans separated after October 1, 1979, should furnish Member 
Copy 2, 4, 8, or any copy of a DD214 Form that includes the COS and 
the narrative reason for separation.  Veterans separated from military 
service after January 1, 1950, should have received  
DD214 Form. Veterans separated from active duty before January 1, 
1950, received documentation other than DD214 Form.  To be 
acceptable, it should indicate: 
 
a)  LOS, and 
b)  COS 
 
 
b. Veterans  Proof of service for Veterans on active duty is a Statement of Service (SOS) 
Still on Active  signed by, or by the direction of, the adjutant, personnel office, or commander 
Duty  of the unit or higher headquarters they are attached to. There is no one unique 
form used by the military for an SOS.  While an SOS is typically on military 
letterhead, it may also be electronic and both are acceptable.  The SOS must 
clearly show the: 
 
  Veteran’s full name, 
  social Security Number (SSN) or the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
  entry date on active duty, 
  duration of lost time, if any, and 
  name and point of contact for the command or unit.

c. Discharged  There is no one form used by the Reserves or National Guard that is similar to 
Reserve/  DD214 Form.  Selected Reserve describes a member or unit with the Ready 
Guard  Reserve designated by their respective services and approved by the Joint 
Members  Chiefs of Staff as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have 
priority over all other reserves. 
 
The National Guard is a unique element of the U.S. Military that serves both 
community and country.  Any state governor or the President of the United 
States can call on the Guard in a moments notice. 
 
Discharged members of the Army or Air National Guard may submit NGB 
Form 22, Report of Separation and Record of Service, and NGB Form 23B, 
Retirement Points Summary Statement, with the COS document.  Members of 
the Reserves should submit their points statement with COS. 
 
Typically, all members of the Reserves and/or Guard receive an annual 
retirement points summary which indicates the level and length of 
participation.  The applicant should submit the latest retirement point 
statement received, along with evidence of honorable service. 
 
VA will accept legible copies. 
 
d. Current  Individuals who are still members of the Reserves/National Guard must 
Reserve/  provide an SOS signed by, or by the direction of, the adjutant, personnel

Members  There is no one form used uniformly by the military for an SOS.  While an 
SOS is typically on military letterhead, some may be electronic and both are 
acceptable.  
  
The statement of service must clearly show the: 
 
  Veteran’s full name, 
  the SSN or the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
  entry date of the applicant’s Reserve/Guard duty, and 
  the unit must state the creditable (actually drilled) years served in the 
Reserves or the National Guard.

and/or Guard  in an active or drilling status in the Reserves or Guard (unless released earlier 
specifically for a service-connected disability).  The applicant must have

i. Exceptions  There are numerous exceptions to the LOS requirements outlined in this 
to LOS  section.  For example, 1 day of service is sufficient for an individual who is 
discharged or released from service (regular active duty or Reserve/National 
Guard) due to a service-connected disability which would be listed on the 
discharge paperwork.  Because of the complexity and number of exceptions, 
this chapter does not attempt to cover all of them.  Because there are 
exceptions, lenders should not assume a Veteran is not eligible.  Instead, they 
should create an application and allow VA to make a formal determination of 
eligibility.

6. Restoration of Previously Used Entitlement 
   
a. Basic  Entitlement previously used in connection with a VA home loan may be 
Restoration  restored under certain circumstances.  Once restored, it can be used again for 
another VA loan.  Restoration of previously used entitlement is possible if: 
 
  property which secured the VA-guaranteed loan has been sold, and the 
loan has been paid in full; or 
  eligible Veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding 
balance on a VA loan and substitute his or her entitlement for the 
same amount originally used on the loan.  The assuming Veteran, 
substituting his/her entitlement, must also meet occupancy, income, 
and credit requirements.  This should be completed before requesting 
the Loan Guaranty Certificate in WebLGY, on the new loan. 
 
   
b. Special  In addition to the basic restoration criteria outlined above, a  
Restoration  Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on a prior VA loan 
Cases  under any of the following circumstances: 
 
  Regular “cash-out” refinance where the prior VA loan has been paid 
in full and the Veteran has made application for a refinance loan to be 
secured by the same property which secured the prior VA loan.  This 
includes refinancing situations, in which the prior loan will be paid off 
at closing from a VA refinancing loan on the same property, or 
  One –time restoration where the prior VA loan has been paid in full, 
but the Veteran has not disposed of the property securing the loan.  
The Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on the 
prior loan in order to purchase a different property, one time only.  
Once such restoration is used, the Veteran’s COE will indicate the 
one-time restoration.  The COE will also advise that any future 
restoration (purchase or cash-out refinance) will require disposal of all 
property or properties obtained with a VA loan. 
 
Example.  A Veteran used all his entitlement to purchase a home for 
$453,100 in a non-high cost county in Maryland.  Prior to job relocation to 
GA, he refinanced the loan to a non-VA loan.  The loan was paid in full; 
however, he still owned the property.  He now wants to purchase a home in 
GA and applies for a one-time restoration.  This is possible.  If the Veteran 
wants to use the benefit in the future for another purchase or regular “cash-
out” refinancing, both properties would have to be disposed of before 
entitlement can be restored.

of Value (NOV), and 
• the lenders needs in terms of secondary market 
requirements. 
Downpayment  No downpayment is required by VA unless the purchase price  3 of this 
exceeds the reasonable value of the property, or the loan is a  chapter 
Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM).  The lender may 
require a downpayment if necessary to meet secondary market 
requirements. 
Amount of  Guaranty is the amount VA may pay a lender in the event of  4 of this 
Guaranty  loss due to foreclosure.    chapter

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
• Subsection a has been updated to remove information on cooperative units. 
  
a. List of  The law authorizes VA to guarantee loans made to eligible veterans only for 
Eligible Loan  the following purposes: 
Purposes   
• To purchase or construct a residence, including a condominium unit to be 
owned and occupied by the veteran as a home: 
−  the loan may include simultaneous purchase of the land on which the 
residence is situated or will be situated, 
−  loans may also be guaranteed for the construction of a residence on land 
already owned by the veteran  (a portion of the loan may be used to 
refinance a purchase money mortgage or sales contract for the purchase of 
the land, subject to reasonable value requirements), and 
−  the residential property may not consist of more than four family units 
and one business unit except in the case of certain joint loans.  (See 
section 1 of chapter 7 for this exception.) 
• To refinance an existing VA-guaranteed or direct loan for the purpose of a 
lower interest rate. 
• To refinance an existing mortgage loan or other indebtedness secured by a 
lien of record on a residence owned and occupied by the veteran as a home. 
• To repair, alter, or improve a residence owned by the veteran and occupied 
as a home. 
• To simultaneously purchase and improve a home. 
• To improve a residence owned and occupied by the veteran as the veteran’s 
home through the installation of a solar heating system, a solar heating and 
cooling system, or a combined solar heating and cooling system, or through 
the application of a residential energy conservation measure.  These energy 
efficiency improvement loans can be made in conjunction with any type of 
VA purchase or refinancing loan. 
• To purchase a one-family residential unit in a condominium housing 
development approved by VA. 
• To purchase a farm residence to be owned and occupied by the veteran as a 
home.  If the loan includes the purchase of farmland, the farmland is 
appraised at its residential value only.  (See section 12 of chapter 11).

b. Ineligible  VA cannot guarantee loans made for ineligible loan purposes.  Examples of 
Loan Purposes  ineligible loan purposes include: 
 
• Purchase of unimproved land with the intent to improve it at some future 
date (that is, the land purchase is not in conjunction with a construction 
loan). 
• Purchase or construction of a dwelling for investment purposes. 
• Purchase or construction of a combined residential and business property, 
unless, 
−  the property is primarily for residential purposes, 
−  there is not more than one business unit, and 
−  the nonresidential area does not exceed 25 percent of the total floor area. 
• Purchase of more than one separate residential unit or lot unless the veteran 
will occupy one unit and there is evidence that: 
−  the residential units are unavailable separately, 
−  the residential units have a common owner, 
−  the residential units have been treated as one unit in the past, and 
−  the residential units are assessed as one unit, or 
−  partition is not practical, as when one unit serves the other(s) in some 
respect; for example, common approaches or driveways. 
 
c. Cash to  Cash to the veteran from loan proceeds is permissible only for certain types of 
Veteran  refinancing loans and under very limited circumstances, as follows: 
Generally Not   
an Eligible 
• For IRRRLs, see section 1 of chapter 6. 
Loan Purpose 
• For cash-out refinancing loans, see section 3 of chapter 6. 
 
For other types of refinancing loans and all purchase/acquisition loans, the 
veteran generally cannot receive cash from loan proceeds.  The only 
exception is the refund of items for which the veteran paid cash, which were 
subsequently included in the loan amount. 
 
Example:  Earnest money can be refunded to the veteran on a no-
downpayment loan.

size of those loans to the maximums prescribed by Government National 
Mortgage Association (GNMA) or whatever conduit they use to sell the 
loans.

b.  Because VA loans can be for the full reasonable value of the property, no 
Downpayment  downpayment is required by VA except in the following circumstances: 
 
• If the purchase price exceeds the reasonable value of the property, a 
downpayment in the amount of the difference must be made in cash from 
the borrower’s own resources, and 
• VA requires a downpayment on all GPMs. 
 
If a veteran has less than full entitlement available, a lender may require a 
downpayment in order to make the veteran a loan that meets GNMA or other 
secondary market requirements.  The “rule of thumb” for GNMA is that the 
VA guaranty, or a combination of VA guaranty plus downpayment and/or 
equity, must cover at least 25 percent of the loan.

4.  Maximum Guaranty on VA Loans 
  
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to note that Public Law 112-154 extended the 
temporary guaranty increase from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 
2014.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.   
  
a. Maximum  Public Law 112-154, the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp 
Guaranty Table  Lejeune Families Act of 2012, signed August 6, 2012, extended the 
temporary increase in the maximum guaranty.  The increase expired 
December 31, 2011, but Public Law 112-154, extended it through December 
31, 2014.  The maximum guaranty varies depending on the location of the 
property.  While VA does not have a maximum loan amount, there are 
effective “loan limits” for high-cost counties.  The limits are derived by 
considering both the median home price for a county and the Freddie Mac 
conforming loan limit.  To aid lenders in determining the maximum guaranty 
in high-cost counties, VA has created a Loan Limit chart, with instructions.  
This will be updated yearly. 
 
• In general, maximum guaranty, assuming the veteran has full entitlement, is 
as shown in the table below.

5.  Occupancy 
 
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• Subsection c has been updated to note that Public Law 112-154, the 
Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 
2012, signed August 6, 2012, expands occupancy to include dependent 
children.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.  
  
a. The Law on  The law requires a veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan to certify that he 
Occupancy  or she intends to personally occupy the property as his or her home.  As of the 
date of certification, the veteran must either 
 
• personally live in the property as his or her home, or 
• intend, upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the dwelling, to 
personally move into the property and use it as his or her home within a 
reasonable time. 
 
The above requirement applies to all types of VA-guaranteed loans except 
IRRRLs.  For IRRRLs, the veteran need only certify that he or she previously 
occupied the property as his or her home. 
 
Example:  A veteran living in a home purchased with a VA loan is transferred 
to a duty station overseas.  The veteran rents out the home.  He/she may 
refinance the VA loan with an IRRRL based on previous occupancy of the 
home. 
 
b. What is a  Occupancy within a “reasonable time" means within 60 days after the loan 
“Reasonable  closing.  More than 60 days may be considered reasonable if both of the 
Time?”  following conditions are met: 
 
• the veteran certifies that he or she will personally occupy the property as his 
or her home at a specific date after loan closing, and 
• there is a particular future event that will make it possible for the veteran to 
personally occupy the property as his or her home on a specific future date. 
 
Occupancy at a date beyond 12 months after loan closing generally cannot be 
considered reasonable by VA.

Dependent 
dependent child, the veteran’s attorney-in-fact or legal guardian of the 
Child 
dependent child must make the certification and sign VA Form 26-1820, 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement. 
 
Occupancy by the spouse may also satisfy the requirement if the veteran 
cannot personally occupy the dwelling within a reasonable time due to distant 
employment other than military service. In these specific cases, consult your 
Regional Loan Center (RLC) to determine if this type of occupancy meets 
VA requirements. 
 
Note:  The cost of maintaining separate living arrangements should be 
considered in underwriting the loan. 
 
For an IRRRL, a certification that the spouse or dependent child (or children) 
previously occupied the dwelling as a home will satisfy the requirement. 
 
 
d. Occupancy  Single or married servicemembers, while deployed from their permanent 
Requirements   duty station, are considered to be in a temporary duty status and able to 
for Deployed   meet the occupancy requirement.  This is true without regard to whether or

not a spouse will be available to occupy the property prior to the veteran’s 
Servicemembers

e. Occupancy  If the veteran states that he or she will retire within 12 months and wants a 
After  loan to purchase a home in the retirement location: 
Retirement   
• Verify the veteran’s eligibility for retirement on the specified date. 
- Include a copy of the veteran’s application for retirement submitted to his 
or her employer. 
• Carefully consider the applicant’s income after retirement. 
- If retirement income alone is insufficient, obtain firm commitments from 
an employer that meet the usual stability of income requirements. 
 
Note:  Only retirement on a specific date within 12 months qualifies.  
Retirement “within the next few years” or “in the near future” is not 
sufficient.

repairs. 
   
g. Intermittent  The veteran need not maintain a physical presence at the property on a daily

located within reasonable proximity of the veteran’s place of employment.  If 
the veteran’s employment requires the veteran’s absence from home a 
substantial amount of time, the following two conditions must be met: 
 
• the veteran must have a history of continuous residence in the community, 
and 
• there must be no indication that the veteran has established, intends to 
establish, or may be required to establish, a principal residence elsewhere.

• VA Form 26-1820, Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement, at the 
time of loan closing (all loans).   
 
This satisfies the lender’s obligation to obtain the veteran’s occupancy 
certification. 
 
The lender may accept the occupancy certification at face value unless there 
is specific information indicating the veteran will not occupy the property as a 
home or does not intend to occupy within a reasonable time after loan closing. 
 
Where doubt exists, the test is whether a reasonable basis exists for 
concluding that the veteran can and will occupy the property as certified.  
Contact the appropriate VA office if the lender cannot resolve issues 
involving the veteran’s intent by applying this test.

lender/borrower agreements are violated.  The following procedure applies in 
such cases.  
 
Any increase in the interest rate of more than one percent requires: 
 
• re-underwriting to ascertain the veteran’s continued ability to qualify for the 
loan, 
• documentation of the change, and 
• a new or corrected Uniform Residential Loan Application, (URLA) with 
any corrections initialed and dated by the borrower.

the VA funding fee, if the funding fee will be paid from loan proceeds. 
 
b. When Can  Discount points may be rolled into the loan only in the case of refinancing

A maximum of two discount points can be rolled into the loan. 
 
If the borrower pays more than two points, the remainder must be paid in 
cash. 
 
Refinancing of Construction Loans, etc. 
Loans to refinance are: 
 
• a construction loan, 
• an installment land sales contract, or 
• a loan assumed by the veteran at an interest rate higher than that for the 
proposed refinancing loan   
 
Any reasonable amount of discount points may be rolled into the loan as long 
as the sum of the outstanding balance of the loan plus allowable closing costs 
and discount points does not exceed the VA reasonable value.  
 
Reference:  See the maximum loan limitations in section 3 of this chapter. 
 
Cash-out Refinancing Loans 
While discount points cannot specifically be included in the loan amount, the 
borrower can receive cash from loan proceeds, subject to maximum loan 
limits (See section 3 of this chapter).  The cash received by the borrower can 
be used for any purpose acceptable to the lender, including payment of 
reasonable discount points.

9.  Amortization 
    
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Requirement  All VA loans must be amortized if the maturity date is beyond 5 years from 
the date of the loan.  Loans with terms less than 5 years are considered term 
loans and need not be amortized. 
 
Generally, for amortized VA loans: 
 
• payments must be approximately equal, 
• principal must be reduced at least once annually, and 
• the final installment must not exceed two times the average of the preceding 
installments. 
 
Exceptions to these requirements are made in the case of: 
 
• GPMs – See section 7 of chapter 7, 
• Growing Equity Mortgages (GEMs) – See section 8 of chapter 7, 
• alternative amortization plans prior approved by VA, and 
• construction loans.

• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Protection  VA guarantees a portion of the loan, identified on the VA Loan Guaranty 
Against Loss  Certificate (LGC) by percentage and dollar amounts.  If a loss ultimately 
occurs on the loan, VA will reimburse the loan holder for all or part of such 
loss: 
 
• limited by the stated percentage and dollar amount of the guaranty, 
• limited by any VA maximums for reasonable and customary foreclosure 
expenses, and 
• subject to the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
b. Lender  It is the lender’s responsibility to comply with all laws and regulations related 
Responsibility  to the VA Home Loan program, and thereby prevent VA’s denial or reduction 
of a payment on a future claim.  A lender can accomplish this by ensuring that 
its employees who perform work related to VA lending: 
 
• understand and comply with VA policies, procedures and regulations, and 
applicable law, and 
• direct questions to VA when issues arise that are not addressed in this 
handbook or other materials provided by VA. 
 
c. When is a  A loan is automatically guaranteed by VA upon closing (prior to issuance of 
Loan that was  the LGC) provided the loan was made by: 
Closed   
Automatically 
• a supervised or a nonsupervised lender with automatic authority, and

• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations.

d. When is a  A prior approval loan is also guaranteed by VA upon closing (prior to 
Prior Approval  issuance of the LGC) provided: 
Loan   
Guaranteed?  
• the closed loan matches the proposed loan upon which the Certificate of 
Commitment was based, and 
• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations. 
  
e. What is  Evidence of guaranty is VA Form 26-1899, Loan Guaranty Certificate, which 
Evidence of  is generated electronically via VA’s webLGY application.  The LGC 
Guaranty?  represents tangible proof to the lender that VA’s guaranty is given in good 
faith.  It is contingent upon: 
 
• the veteran, property and purpose of the loan being eligible, 
• no fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the lender, and 
• the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
For example, VA may deny or reduce payment on a future claim based on the 
lender or holder’s noncompliance whether or not VA has issued evidence of 
guaranty on the loan. 
 
The LGC also has an audit indicator that, if noted Yes, lets the lender know 
the case has been identified for full review.  In these instances, the lender then 
needs to submit a complete loan origination package to the appropriate VA 
office for review.  Packages should be submitted within 15 days of the LGC 
being generated. 
 
f. Total Loss of  Willful fraud or material misrepresentation by the lender or holder, or by an 
Guaranty  agent of either, will relieve VA of liability for payment of any claim on the 
loan.  VA also has no liability in the case of: 
 
• forgery on the note, mortgage, loan application, or other loan documents, or 
• a Certificate of Eligibility or discharge papers that are counterfeited, 
falsified, or not issued by the Government. 
 
A holder of a VA loan who acquired the loan without notice or knowledge of 
fraud or material misrepresentation in procuring the guaranty will not be 
denied payment of any claim on the loan by reason of such fraud or material 
misrepresentation.

g. Partial Loss  A holder of a VA loan who fails to comply with applicable laws and 
of Guaranty  regulations may receive only partial payment of a claim if VA’s liability 
increases due to the holder’s noncompliance.  Material misrepresentation 
which is not willful has the same consequence.  
 
No claim will be paid on such loan until the amount of any increase in VA’s 
liability is known.  The burden of proof is on the holder to establish that VA’s 
increased liability is not due to the holder’s noncompliance or 
misrepresentation. 
 
Examples of noncompliance with applicable law and regulations which may 
lead to an increase in VA’s liability include: 
 
• failure to obtain and retain the required lien on property to secure the loan, 
• failure to include the power to substitute trustees, 
• failure to procure and maintain insurance coverage, 
• failure to advise VA as to default, 
• failure to provide notice of intention to begin foreclosure action, 
• failure to provide notice to VA in any suit or action, or notice of sale, 
• improper release, conveyance, substitution or exchange of security, 
• lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction, 
• failure to assure that escrowed/earmarked funds are expended in accordance 
with the agreement, and 
• failure to take into consideration limitations upon the quantum or quality of 
the estate or property.

1. General Underwriting Information    
   
Change Date  February 22, 2019  
•  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  VA Underwriting Standards require lenders to always utilize the following 
Underwriting  guidance when underwriting VA-guaranteed loans: 
Information     
Lenders are encouraged to make VA loans to all qualified Veterans who apply.  
VA’s underwriting standards are intended to provide guidelines for 
underwriters.  Decisions must be based on sound application of the standards, 
and underwriters are expected to use good judgment and flexibility in applying 
underwriting guidelines.  Not all possible circumstances are addressed 
therefore, underwriters must apply reasonable judgment and flexibility in 
administering this important Veterans’ benefit. 
 
b. Basic  By law, VA may only guarantee a loan when it is possible to determine that 
Requirements  the Veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, and has present or verified anticipated 
income that bears a proper relation to the anticipated terms of repayment.  
VA’s underwriting standards are incorporated into VA regulations at  
38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and explained in this chapter.  This chapter addresses the 
procedures for verifications and analysis involved in underwriting a  
VA-guaranteed loan.  In the event the lender fails to perform their 
responsibilities, VA may take administrative actions including removal of 
authority to underwrite and close VA loans.

Responsibilities   
•  developing all credit information, 
•  properly obtaining all required verifications and the credit report,

based,

guidelines, and

d. Lender’s  Digital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature as 
Procedures  defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 
commonly referred to as the E-sign Act. 
 
The procedures below address only the credit underwriting of the loan.   
Chapter 5 of this handbook provides all procedures that must be completed 
when making a VA loan.   
 
Step  Action 
1   Initiate the VA and Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System 
(CAIVRS) inquiries described in Topic 4, Subsection c of this  
chapter. 
2   Obtain all necessary verifications.   
 
The borrower’s authorization can be obtained separately for the 
lender’s required verifications, or on one blanket authorization form.  
  
The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) obtained from WebLGY 
provides verification of the amount of the Veteran’s available 
entitlement, verification of exempt/non-exempt from the VA Funding 
Fee, and the amount of VA monthly service connected disability 
compensation.  Order the COE before ordering the VA appraisal. 
 
The tri-merged credit report and verifications can be ordered by the 
lender or its agent or a party designated by the lender to perform that 
function.  However, these documents must always be delivered by the 
credit reporting agency or verifying party directly to the lender or its 
agent, and never to another party.  VA only permits the Veteran to 
pay for the credit report invoiced amount, not any additional costs 
that the lender may incur through other parties for obtaining the 
credit report.

2. Income – Required Documentation and Analysis
Change Date  September 26, 2019 
• Subsection k has been updated for clarification.
It is the underwriter’s objective to identify and verify income available to 
a.  meet: 
Underwriter’s 
Objectives 
• the mortgage payment,
• other shelter expenses,
• debts and obligations, and
• family living expenses.
b.Effective Income is considered effective when it is determined to be verifiable, stable 
Income and reliable, and anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future. Income 
analysis is not an exact science.  It requires the lender to underwrite each loan 
on a case-by-case basis, using good judgement and flexibility when warranted.
To determine whether income is stable and reliable, the probability of 
continued employment must be determined through examination of the: 
• borrower’s past employment record,
• borrower’s training, education, and qualifications for his or her current
position, and/or
• type of employment.
Only verified income can be considered in the repayment calculation.

c. Spousal  Verify and treat the income of a spouse who will be contractually obligated on 
Income  the loan the same as you would the income of a Veteran borrower that will be 
obligated on the loan.  However, to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act (ECOA), do not ask questions about the income of the 
borrower’s spouse unless the: 
 
•  spouse will be contractually liable, 
•  borrower is relying on the spouse’s income to qualify, 
•  borrower is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance 
payments from the spouse or former spouse, or 
•  borrower resides and/or the property is in a community property state.  
 
In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be 
requested and considered in the same manner as for the borrower, even if the 
spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan.  See Topic 5, subsection 
a, of this chapter for additional guidelines for community property states when 
considering a spouse’s debts and credit history. 
 
The non-purchasing spouse’s (NPS) credit history does not need to be 
considered; however, the NPS’ liabilities must be considered to determine the 
extent of the household liabilities. 
 
d. ECOA  Always inform the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) that they do not have 
Considerations  to divulge information on the receipt of child support, alimony, or separate 
maintenance.  However, for this income to be considered in the loan analysis, 
it must be divulged and verified. 
 
Income cannot be discounted because of sex, marital status, age, race, or other 
prohibited bases under ECOA.

Non-Military  current position, 2 years of employment is a positive indicator of continued 
Employment  employment. 
 
If the borrower has been employed by the present employer less than 2 years: 
 
•  verify prior employment, plus present employment covering a total of 
2 years, or 
•  provide an explanation of why 2 years of employment could not be 
verified, 
•  compare any different types of employment verifications obtained 
(such as Verification of Employment (VOE), paystub(s), W2s, and tax 
returns) for consistency, and  
•  clarify any substantial differences in the data that would have a bearing 
on the qualification of the borrower(s).  
 
Use of Employment Verification Services 
 
Lenders may use any employment verification service that provides the same 
information as the “full” verification generated through the “Work Number” 
for all applicants. Generally, this will include the following information: 
 
•  the current date, 
•  employer name and address, 
•  Veteran’s full legal name, social security number (complete or 
truncated) and job title, 
•  employment status (Active or Inactive),

certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original. 
 
The lender may not charge a fee to obtain the employment verification 
information. 
 
Verification with VA Standard Documentation 
 
Acceptable verification consists of VA Form 26-8497, Request for Verification 
of Employment (VOE) or any format which furnishes the same information as 
VA Form 26-8497, plus: 
 
•  paystub(s) covering the most recent 30-day period with year-to-date 
information, if the employer normally provides a pay stub(s) to the 
borrower. 
•  if the employer does not indicate the probability of continued 
employment on the VOE, the lender is not required to request anything 
additional on that subject. 
 
The VOE and paystub(s) must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for 
new construction) from the closing date. 
 
•  For loans closed automatically, the date of the VOE and pay stub(s) 
must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for 
new construction) from the closing date. 
•  For prior approval loans, the date of the VOE and paystub(s) must be 
within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 
days for new construction) from the closing date.

(b)  Signed and dated individual income tax returns for the previous 2 years, 
and 
 
(c)  If borrower works out of a union, evidence of the union’s history with 
the borrower. 
 
Alternative Verification Documentation 
 
Alternative documentation may be submitted in place of a VOE if the lender 
concludes that the borrower’s income is stable, reliable, and anticipated to 
continue for the foreseeable future; that is, if the borrower’s income qualifies 
as effective income.  Two years of employment with the same employer is not 
required to reach this conclusion. 
 
Alternative documentation consists of:  
 
•  paystub(s) covering at least the most recent 30-day period with year-to 
date information, 
•  W-2 Forms for the most recent 2 years, and/or 
•  telephone verification of the borrower’s current employment.

Determine whether the borrower’s past employment, training, and/or 
education equipped him or her with particular skills that relate directly to the 
duties of their current position.  
 
If the probability of continued employment is high based on these factors, then 
the lender may consider including the income in the total effective income.   
 
An explanation of why income of less than 12 months duration was used must 
be documented on the VA 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
If the probability of continued employment is good, but not well supported, the

i. Income from  Verify commission income by obtaining the VOE or other written verification 
Commissions  which provides the following: 
 
•  the actual amount of commissions paid year-to-date, 
•  the basis for payments (salary plus commission, straight commission, or 
draws against commission, or other), and  
•  when commissions are paid bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, 
semiannually, annually, or other.  
•  individual income tax returns, signed and dated, plus all applicable 
schedules for the previous 2 years (or additional periods if needed to 
demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record). 
 
Analyze Income Derived from Commissions  
 
Generally, income from commissions is considered stable when the borrower 
has obtained such income for at least 2 years. Employment for less than 2 years 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous 
related employment and/or specialized training. Employment of less than 1 
year can rarely qualify; however, in-depth development is required for a 
conclusion of stable income on less than 1 year cases. 
 
For a borrower who will qualify using commission income of less than 25 
percent of the total annual employment income, IRS Form 2106 expenses are 
not required to be deducted from income even if they are reported on IRS Form 
2106. Additionally, the expenses are not required to be added as a monthly 
liability for the borrower. 
 
For a borrower earning commission income that is 25 percent or more of 
annual employment income, IRS Form 2106 expenses must be deducted from 
gross commission income regardless of the length of time the borrower has 
filed the expenses with the IRS.

borrower has obtained such income for at least 2 years. Less-than-2-years 
Guideline, 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous

Determine whether the business can be expected to generate sufficient income 
for the borrower’s future needs. 
 
If the business shows a steady or significant decline in earnings over the 
period analyzed, the reasons for such decline must be analyzed to determine 
whether the trend is likely to continue or be reversed. 
 
If it is difficult to determine the probability of continued operation, obtain 
documentation on the viability and potential future earnings, and an 
explanation of the function and financial operations of the business from a 
qualified party.

What is reported to the IRS on a joint return must be used when applying for a 
federally guaranteed loan. 
 
On a joint tax return, the loss must be deducted from the borrower’s income in 
both community and non-community property states. 
 
On a joint tax return, when a borrower and co-borrower have been faced with 
business losses, the Veteran/borrower and his/her spouse may want to consider 
both being on the loan in order to potentially qualify.  The credit of both 
borrowers will be considered.

k. Active  For active-duty military borrowers, a Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) is 
Military  required instead of a VOE.  The LES must be an original, electronic, or a copy 
Borrower’s  certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original.     
Income 
 
The LES must furnish the same information as a VOE and must be no more 
than 120 days old (180 days for new construction), from the date of closing. 
 
For loans closed automatically, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of 
the date the note is signed (180 days for new construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of the 
date the application is received by VA (180 days for new construction).  
 
In addition, identify servicemembers who are within 12 months of release 
from active duty or the end of their contract term. For an enlisted 
servicemember, find the date of expiration (ETS) of the borrower’s current 
contract for active service on the LES.  For National Guard or Reserve 
members, find the ETS of the borrower’s current contract on the LES.  Also, if 
a National Guard or Reserve member is currently serving on active duty, also 
identify the expiration date of the current active-duty tour.  If the date is within 
12 months of the projected date that the loan will close, the loan package must 
also include one of the following items, or combinations of items, to be 
acceptable: 
 
•  documentation that the servicemember has already re-enlisted or 
extended his/her period of active duty to a date beyond the 12-month 
period following the projected closing of the loan, or 
•  documentation that the servicemember has already re-enlisted or 
extended his/her period of active-duty service to a date beyond the  
12-month period following the projected closing of the loan, or 
•  verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or 
verification of military retirement income following the release from 
active-duty service, or

Income, 
commanding officer confirming that the servicemember is eligible to 
continued 
re-enlist or extend his/her active-duty service as indicated, and (2) the 
commanding officer has no reason to believe that such re-enlistment or 
extension of active-duty service will not be granted, or  
•  documentation of other unusual strong positive underwriting factors, 
such as a downpayment of at least 10 percent from the borrower’s own 
assets (not a gift), a minimum of 6 months PITI, in cash, after the 
downpayment from the borrower’s own assets (not a gift) or clear 
evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a non-military 
spouse’s income so high that only minimal income from the active-duty 
servicemember is needed to qualify.  
 
If an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES, 
the above documentation is not required unless there is evidence that the 
Officer has resigned his or her commission.   
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates her ETS date listed on her 
LES is 171031 (October 31, 2017) and the projected date of closing is October 
1, 2017.  Therefore, one of the above items is needed to verify future income 
since her ETS date is less than 12 months from the projected date of closing. 
 
Example: A member of the Reserves has been called to Active Duty.  The 
ETS date on his LES indicates 181031 (October 31, 2018); however, his active 
duty orders indicate his active duty tour will not exceed the next 60 days.  
Therefore, since he will be leaving active duty before 12 months of the 
projected closing date, the active-duty income cannot be considered, and his 
civilian employment and drill duty will need to be considered. 
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates his ETS date is less than 1 
month from the anticipated date of closing, and he indicates he will be 
receiving military retirement and has accepted civilian employment.  Verify 
his future retirement income from the Department of Defense and verify future 
civilian employment with the Veteran’s new employer.

Borrower’s   
Income, 
Any subsistence (rations) and clothing allowances are indicated on the LES. 
continued 
The lender may include verified allowances in effective income.  These 
allowances are not taxable income. The clothing allowance generally appears 
on the LES as an annual amount.  Convert the annual amount to a monthly 
amount for the Loan Analysis. 
 
Verification and Analysis of Other Military Allowances 
 
To consider a military allowance in the underwriting analysis, obtain 
verification of the type and amount of the military allowance, how long the 
borrower has received it and the continuance into the foreseeable future. 
 
Military allowances may be included in effective income only if such income 
can be expected to continue because of the nature of the borrower’s assigned 
duties.  Such allowances include, but are not limited to:  
 
•  proficiency pay, such as linguistic, parachute, scuba, flight or hazard 
pay, and  
•  overseas or combat pay (sea pay, submarine, etc.) 
 
All types of allowances above are subject to periodic review and/or testing of 
the recipient to ascertain whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if 
it can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be 
expected to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, 
should the income be added to base pay. Contact the borrower’s chain of 
command if there are questions regarding the continuance of the income. 
 
If the duration of the military allowance cannot be determined, this source of 
income may still be used to offset short term obligations of 6 to 24 months 
duration. 
 
Consult the IRS to determine if any allowances for pay are considered taxable 
income by the IRS, unlike housing, clothing, and subsistence allowances.

Income from Recently Activated Members of the Reserve or National 
Guard 
 
Lenders must consider if a borrower, whose income is being used to qualify 
for a loan, may have a change in income due to participation in a 
Reserves/National Guard unit subject to activation. 
 
If an activated Reserves/National Guard member applies for a loan, they must 
present orders indicating their current active duty tour is not to exceed 12 
months.   
 
Example: The borrower’s full-time civilian employment is $3,000 per month.  
The borrower’s current income from the Reserves due to activation is $3,500 
per month and orders are for 12 months.  Since the borrower’s full-time 
civilian employment is only $3,000 per month, the $3,000 should be used to 
qualify the borrower. 
 
There are not any clear-cut procedures that can be applied to all cases.  
Evaluate all aspects of each individual case, including credit history, 
accumulation of assets, overall employment history, and make the best 
decision for each loan regarding the use of income in qualifying for the loan.  
 
It is very important that loan files be carefully and thoroughly documented, 
including any reasons for using or not using Reserve/National Guard income 
in these situations. 
 
As a lender, the goal is to provide the Veteran their benefit without placing 
him/her in a financial hardship.

VA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be 
documented for the likelihood of continuance. 
 
VA disability income verification will be placed on the COE.  However, there 
are some instances where this income is not placed on the COE which may 
include if the Veteran: 
 
•  will be discharging within the next 6 months from the military and has 
completed a Physical Exam Board (PEB) or Medical Review Board 
(MEB) and will be filing for VA disability while still on active duty, 
•  has recently filed for VA disability and VA’s Compensation Service 
has not yet made a determination and would be entitled to receive VA 
disability benefits, 
•  would be entitled to receive VA disability benefits, but for the receipt 
of retired pay, 
•  has received VA disability benefits in the past, or 
•  is an unmarried surviving spouse of a Veteran who is eligible for or 
receiving qualifying Disability and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), or 
•  is in receipt of a VA nonservice connected pension, or  
•  has a VA-appointed Fiduciary to handle financial matters. 
 
If the Veteran falls under one of the above categories, perform the following: 
 
•  Submit by fax VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA Benefits, to the 
VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) where the subject property is located.  
VA will complete and return the form to the lender by return fax.

the loan package. 
 
If the form indicates that the borrower receives a non service-connected 
pension or has a VA Fiduciary, the loan cannot be closed automatically.  The 
loan must be uploaded in WebLGY for prior approval.  See Chapter 5 of this 
handbook for the necessary documentation that must be submitted to VA.   
 
VA must review, underwrite, and issue a Certificate of Commitment before 
the loan can close.  See Chapter 5 of this handbook for prior approval

Verification of Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Home 
 
Obtain a copy of the rental agreement for the property, if any. 
 
Analysis using Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Loan 
 
Use the prospective rental income only to offset the mortgage payment on the 
rental property, and only if there is not an indication that the property will be 
difficult to rent. This rental income may not be included in effective income. 
 
Obtain a working knowledge of the local rental market.  If there is not a lease 
on the property, but the local rental market is very strong, the lender may still 
consider the prospective rental income for offset purposes.  Provide a 
justification on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
       
Reserves are not needed to offset the mortgage payment on the property the 
Veteran occupies prior to the new loan. 
 
Example: The Veteran’s current home has a VA mortgage with a monthly 
PITI payment of $1,000.  Bonus entitlement is being used to purchase a new 
primary residence and the Veteran will rent the previous home for $1,200 
monthly upon closing of the new home.  The payment of $1,200 can be used 
to offset the existing mortgage payment, if all the above conditions are met.  
The additional rent received in excess of the mortgage payment cannot be used 
as effective income. 
 
Verification of Rental Property Income 
 
Obtain the following: 
 
•  documentation of cash reserves totaling at least 3 months mortgage 
payments (PITI), and 
•  individual income tax returns, signed and dated or lender obtained tax 
transcripts, plus all applicable schedules for the previous 2 years, 
which show rental income generated by the property.

Cash proceeds from a VA refinance cannot be counted as the required PITI on 
a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the borrower’s account before 
the new VA loan closes. 
 
Gift funds cannot be used to meet reserve requirements. 
 
Analysis of Rental Property Income 
 
Each property(ies) must have a 2-year rental history itemized on the 
borrower’s tax return. 
 
Property depreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns may be 
included in effective income.  
 
If after adding depreciation to the negative rental income, the borrower still 
has rental loss, the negative income should be deducted from the overall 
income as it reduces the borrower’s income. 
 
If rental income will not, or cannot be used, then the full mortgage payment 
should be considered and reserves do not need to be considered.

reference only the One-Unit Limit column in the FHFA Table “Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac Maximum Loan Limits for Mortgages, located at 
https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads. 
 
Verify cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI), and 
documentation of the borrower’s prior experience managing rental units and/or 
use of a property management company to oversee the property. 
 
Analysis of Multi-Unit Property Securing the VA loan (Veteran will 
occupy one unit as his/her residence) 
 
Include the prospective rental income in effective income only if: 
 
•  the borrower has a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and 
•  cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI). 
 
If each unit is separate and not under one mortgage, 6 months PITI must be 
verified for each separate unit. 
 
Equity in the property cannot be used as reserves to meet PITI requirements.  
This must be the borrower’s own funds, not a gift. 
 
Cash proceeds from a VA regular “Cash-Out” refinance cannot be counted as 
the required PITI on a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the 
borrower’s account before the new VA loan closes. 
 
The amount of rental income to include in effective income is based on 75 
percent of the amount indicated on the lease or rental agreement unless a 
greater percentage can be documented (existing property). 
 
The amount of rental income to include in effective income is based on 75 
percent of the amount indicated on the appraiser’s opinion of the property’s 
fair monthly rental (proposed construction).

q. Automobile  Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related 
or Similar  to a borrower’s employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset 
Allowances  a corresponding car payment.  However, if the borrower reports an allowance 
as part of monthly qualifying income, it must be determined if the automobile 
expense reported on IRS Form 2106 should be deducted from income or 
treated as a liability. 
 
If the reported expense is less than the automobile allowance, the amount can 
be treated as income and added to borrower’s monthly income.  
 
If the reported expense exceeds the automobile allowance, the amount must be 
deducted from income as a net calculation in Section D on VA Form 26-6393, 
Loan Analysis. 
 
Likewise, any other similar type of allowance received by the borrower should 
be considered with regards to the tax returns for determination of an offset of 
the corresponding obligation, as income, or as an expense.

r. Other Types  While not all types of income can be listed, documentation of income must

for at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date to include in effective 
income.  Otherwise, consider whether it is reasonable to use the income to 
offsets short term obligations of 6 to 24 months duration. 
 
“Other” types of income which may be considered as effective income 
include, but are not limited to:  
 
•  pension or other retirement benefits,  
•  disability income, 
•  dividends from stocks or other, 
•  interest from bonds, savings accounts, or others, 
•  royalties, 
•  notes receivable, and 
•  trusts 
 
VA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be 
documented for the likelihood of continuance. A COE will generally have the 
amount of VA disability income listed, however, see Topic 2, subsection m of 
this chapter for exceptions. 
 
A VA award letter or bank statement may also verify the current monthly 
amount received. 
 
The lender may include verified income from public assistance programs in 
effective income if evidence indicates it will likely continue for 3 years or 
more. 
 
The lender may include workers’ compensation income that will continue for 
at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date if the borrower chooses to 
reveal it.  
 
The lender may include verified income received specifically for the care of 
any foster child(ren), only to balance the expenses of caring for the foster 
child(ren) against any increased residual requirements.

r. Other Types  Example: The borrower(s) receive a stipend paid by the county or State for 
of Income,  two foster children living in the residence.  Instead of considering a family size 
continued  of four, a family size of two should be used to determine the residual income 
requirement. 
Do not include temporary income items such as VA educational allowances 
(including the Post 9/11 GI Bill benefit) and unemployment compensation in 
effective income.   
Exception: If unemployment compensation is a regular part of a borrower’s 
income due to the nature of his/her employment (for example, seasonal work), 
it may be included. 
 
A borrower in receipt of VA Pension or Disability benefits with Aid and 
Attendance should be discussed with the VA Pension Service, VA 
Compensation Service, or the VA Hospital where the property is located, to 
determine if the income is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.   
 
If a borrower has a contract for employment in a foreign country (whether or 
not the employer is a US company or corporation), the income can be used if it 
is verified, stable, and reliable.  While some contracts are renewed yearly, 
consider the borrower’s past employment history and the likelihood of the 
contract being extended.   
 
Income that is paid by a foreign employer or government in foreign currency 
should be converted to US dollars.

Change Date 
•  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
   
a. Income Tax  Determine the appropriate deductions for Federal income tax and Social 
and Social  Security using the “Employer’s Tax Guide”, Circular E, issued by the Internal 
Security  Revenue Service (IRS).   
Deductions   
Determine the appropriate deductions for state and local taxes using similar 
materials provided by the states.   
 
The income tax should be based upon the borrower’s residence and what is 
documented in the guide to the IRS, and not solely the amount claimed on the 
paystub. 
 
An active-duty servicemember’s LES may have a different state tax deduction 
than the state where the active-duty servicemember will be purchasing a 
residence or refinancing.  Select the state listed on the LES for the state taxes 
to be considered in state tax deductions. 
 
The lender may consider the borrower’s potential tax benefits from obtaining 
the loan (for example, mortgage interest deduction) in the analysis. To do so: 
 
•  determine what the borrower’s withholding allowance will be, using 
the instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W-4, Employee’s 
Withholding Allowance Certificate, and 
•  apply that withholding number when calculating Federal and state 
income tax deductions on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, then 
•  document the change in deductions in Item 47, Remarks, on VA Form 
26-6393, Loan Analysis.

b. Income Tax  MCCs issued by state and local governments may qualify a borrower for a 
Credits from  Federal tax credit.  The Federal tax credit is based on a certain percentage of 
Mortgage  the borrower’s mortgage interest payment.  Lenders must provide a copy of 
Credit 
the MCC to VA with the loan package which indicates: 
Certificates 
 
(MCC) 
•  documentation verifying any expenses charged by the local 
government entity for the program which is listed on the Closing 
 
Disclosure Statement, and 
  the percentage to be used to calculate the tax credit, and if applicable, the 
amount of the indebtedness.  The certified indebtedness can be comprised of a 
  loan incurred by the borrower to acquire a principal residence or a qualified 
home improvement rehabilitation loan. 
 
 
There is an IRS annual limit on the tax credit equal to the lesser of the 
 
borrower’s maximum tax liability or $2,000.  Calculate the tax credit by 
applying the specified percentage to the interest paid on the certified 
 
indebtedness.  Then apply the annual limit. 
    
Example: The MCC shows a 30 percent rate and $100,000 certified 
  indebtedness.  The borrower will pay approximately $8,000 in annual 
mortgage interest.  The borrower’s estimated total Federal income tax liability 
 
is $9,000.  Calculate the tax credit as follows: 
 
Step  Procedure 
1  30 percent of $8,000 = $2,400 
2  Apply the IRS annual $2,000 limit 
3  The tax credit will be $2,000 
This allows use of $167 (one-twelfth of $2,000) as income to qualify the 
borrower. 
 
If the mortgage on which the borrower pays interest is greater than the amount 
of certified indebtedness, limit the interest used in the tax credit calculation to 
that portion attributable to the certified indebtedness. 
 
Since these programs are offered by state and local government(s), pre-
approval by VA is not required for the borrower to participate in the program.  
The lender is responsible to determine all eligibility requirements are met by 
the borrower to participate in the program.

Amount of 
 
Cash Required 
•  any closing costs, pre-paids, or discount points which are the 
for Closing 
borrower’s responsibility and are not financed into the loan, and 
•  the difference between the sales price and the loan amount, if the sales 
price exceeds the reasonable value established by VA (i.e. negative 
equity).   
 
VA does not require the borrower(s) to have additional cash to cover a certain 
number of mortgage payments, unplanned expenses or other contingencies on 
the residence, or refinance of the Veteran’s residence.   
 
However, the borrower’s ability to accumulate liquid assets and the current 
availability of liquid assets for unplanned expenses should be considered in the 
overall credit analysis. 
 
Reserves are required for borrowers using rental income to qualify.  See Topic 
2, subsection n of this chapter for more information.   
 
A rental offset does not require additional assets to cover PITI.  See Topic 2, 
subsection n of this chapter for more information.   
 
The assets securing a loan(s) against deposited funds (signature loans, cash 
value life insurance policies, 401(k) loans, other) may not be included as an 
asset on the VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis.  See Topic 5 of this chapter for

Cash to Close  on the overall credit analysis (significant assets). Use VA Form 26-8497a, 
Requirements 
Request for Verification of Deposit, or electronic, or certified copies of the 
borrower’s last two bank statements. 
 
Verifications must be no more 120 days old (180 days for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans, this means the date of the deposit verification 
is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the deposit verification is 
within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for 
new construction). 
 
c. Pending Sale  In some cases, the determination that the income and/or assets of borrowers 
of Real Estate  are needed to qualify for the loan depends upon the sale of presently the 
borrower’s owned real property.   
 
The sale proceeds may be necessary to: 
 
•  clear the outstanding mortgage(s) against the property, 
•  pay outstanding consumer obligations,  
•  make a downpayment or pay closing costs on the VA loan, and/or 
•  restore previously used VA entitlement.  
 
Evidence the sale has been completed should be included in the closing 
package to verify proceeds from the sale.    
 
As an alternative, the Veteran may sell the property with the buyer assuming 
the outstanding mortgage obligation.  See Chapter 6 of this handbook for 
assumptions (Release of Liability) with a Substitution of Entitlement to restore 
previously used entitlement. 
 
See Chapter 5 of this handbook for prior approval loans, which depend upon 
the sale of property for the borrower to qualify.

Change Date  February 22, 2019  
  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
 
 
a. Verification 
All debts and obligations of the borrowers’ must be verified and rated. Obtain 
Requirements 
a credit report with all information for all credit bureaus.   See Topic 7, 
for Debts and 
Obligations  subsection a of this chapter for details on the type of credit report required.  
For obligations not included on the credit report which are revealed on the 
application or through other means, the lender must obtain a verification of 
payment history showing the obligation or other written verification directly 
from the creditor, including the payment amount and outstanding balance.  
The lender must also separately verify accounts listed as “will rate by mail 
only” or “need written authorization.” 
 
When a pay stub(s) or LES indicates an allotment, the lender must investigate 
the nature of the allotment to determine whether the allotment is related to a 
debt or other obligation(s).  Examples may include 401K obligation or 
repayment, child care, child support, or other.  
 
For obligations that have not been rated on the credit report or elsewhere, 
obtain the verification and rating directly from the creditor.  Include a written 
explanation for any obligation that is not rated. 
 
Resolve all discrepancies prior to closing.  If the credit report, deposit 
verification, bank statement, or pay stub(s) reveals any debts or obligations 
which were not divulged by the borrowers): 
 
•  obtain clarification as to the status of such debts from the borrower(s), 
then 
•  verify any remaining discrepancies with the creditor. 
 
Credit reports and verifications must be no more than 120 days old (180 days 
for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans, this means the date of the credit report or 
verification is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the credit report or verification 
is within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for 
new construction).

•  if the borrower(s) is relying on alimony, child support, or maintenance 
payments from the spouse (or former spouse), or

If either of these situations is applicable, the lender must: 
 
•  Obtain a credit report on the non-purchasing spouse in addition to the 
Veteran’s credit report. 
•  Consider the spouse’s credit history in reaching a determination.  A 
Veteran borrower with a satisfactory credit history may be considered a 
satisfactory risk even though the non-purchasing spouse’s credit may 
be unsatisfactory.  
•  Include the monthly payment of the non-purchasing spouse’s debts on 
the VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. For debts such as judgments and 
unpaid collection accounts, lenders should consider the Veteran’s 
capacity to address the debt(s).  
•  Develop the facts surrounding any unsatisfied judgments on the 
spouse’s credit report, such as where the judgment was filed and 
whether the parties were married to one another at the time, and secure 
a competent legal opinion whether the judgment may become a lien 
against the property. 
•  Exclude the monthly payment on the spouse’s debts from the loan 
analysis when a reliable source of income for the spouse is verified to 
reach such a conclusion which is voluntarily provided. 
•  Document VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, with an explanation of 
facts and determination when concluding credit worthiness of the 
Veteran or excluding obligations of the non-purchasing spouse.

b. Verification  The payment amount of any alimony and/or child support obligation of the 
of Alimony and  borrower must be verified. 
Child Support   
Obligations 
Do not request documentation of a borrower’s divorce unless it is necessary to 
verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the 
borrower.  If, however, in the routine course of processing the loan, the lender 
encounters direct evidence (such as, in the credit report) that a child support or 
alimony obligation exists, they should make any inquiries necessary to resolve 
discrepancies and obtain the appropriate verification. 
 
Spousal support may be treated as a reduction in income on VA Form 26-
6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
Child support payment is treated as a liability on VA Form 26-6393, Loan 
Analysis. 
 
c. Analysis of  Significant debts and obligations include: 
Debts and   
Obligations 
•  debts and obligations with a remaining term of 10 months or more; that 
is, long-term obligations, and 
•  accounts with a term of less than 10 months that require payments so 
large as to cause a severe impact on the family’s resources for any 
period of time. 
 
Example: Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a 
remaining balance of $1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months, 
would be considered significant.  The payment amount is so large as to cause a 
severe impact on the family’s resources during the first, most critical, months 
of the home loan. 
 
Determine whether debts and obligations which do not fit the description of 
“significant” should be given any weight in the analysis.  They may have an 
impact on the borrower’s ability to provide for family living expenses.

purpose.  See Topic 4, subsection c of this chapter for necessary documents. 
 
f. Secondary  If the borrower(s) plans to obtain a second mortgage simultaneously with the 
Borrowing  VA-guaranteed loan, include the second mortgage payment as a significant 
debt.  From an underwriting standpoint, the Veteran must not be placed in a 
substantially worse position than if the entire amount borrowed had been 
guaranteed by VA.   See Chapter 9 of this handbook for VA limitations on 
secondary borrowing.

continued  does not need to be considered. 
 
If a student loan is in repayment, or scheduled to begin within 12 months from 
the date of VA loan closing, the lender must consider the anticipated monthly 
obligation in the loan analysis and utilize the payment established by 
calculating each loan at a rate of five percent of the outstanding balance 
divided by 12 months. 
 
Example:  A borrower has a $25,000 student loan balance and you multiple it 
by 5%, which equals $1,250.  This amount ($1,250) is divided by 12 months to 
equal a monthly payment of $104.17.  
 
If the payment(s) reported on the credit report for each student loan(s) is 
greater than the threshold payment calculation above in a above, the lender 
must use the payment recorded on the credit report. 
   
If the payment(s) reported on the credit report is less than the threshold 
payment calculation above, in order to count the lower payment, the loan file 
must contain a statement from the student loan servicer that reflects the actual 
loan terms and payment information for each student loan(s). 
 
The statement(s) must be dated within 60 days of VA loan closing, and may be 
an electronic copy from the student loan servicer’s website or a printed 
statement provided by the student loan servicer. 
 
It is the lender’s discretion as to whether the credit report should be 
supplemented with this information.

the Veteran executed a promissory note for the entire debt balance. 
 
VA may find a repayment plan acceptable if: 
 
•  the Veteran has been satisfactorily making payments on a repayment 
plan in effect prior to the lender’s inquiry, 
•  the Veteran’s overall credit history and anticipated financial capacity 
after the proposed loan is made indicate a reasonable likelihood that 
the repayment plan will be honored and the outstanding amount of 
indebtedness is not so large that it would prevent payment in full, 
within a reasonable period (approximately 1 year), or 
•  the case involves unusually meritorious circumstances. 
 
Examples 
 
Consideration would be given to a Veteran with an outstanding/excellent 
credit history and adequate income whose debt balance is too large to be 
reasonably paid out in less than 18 months to 2 years.   
 
VA will offer special consideration to a Veteran’s claim that he or she was not 
previously aware of an overpayment of benefits.

(CAIVRS)? 
 
The database includes default information from the Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Education, Department of Justice, HUD, Small Business 
Administration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and VA. 
   
The VA default information included in the database relates to: 
 
•  overpayments on education cases, 
•  overpayments on disability benefits income, and 
•  claims paid due to home loan foreclosures which resulted in a debt of 
the government (Generally type 2 VA loans). 
 
CAIVRS Procedures 
 
A CAIVRS inquiry must be performed for all borrowers and co-borrowers 
(Veteran or non-Veteran) on all VA loans, including IRRRLs. The one 
exception to this policy is that CAIVRS is not required for non-purchasing 
spouses in community property states. 
 
VA assigns a 10-digit VA lender identification number (ID) to each new 
lender, then automatically forwards the ID number to HUD with a request to 
grant the lender CAIVRS access.  The lender can begin accessing CAIVRS 
usually between 7 to 10 business days after receiving its VA ID number 
assignment. 
 
To register for CAIVRS access for first time users, please use the following 
link: https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/f57register.cfm. 
 
Please direct questions concerning problems encountered with accessing 
CAIVRS to caivrs_admin@hud.gov.  
 
If the borrower(s) is found to have a delinquent federal debt through CAIVRS, 
the validity and delinquency status of the debt should be verified by contacting 
the creditor agency using the contact phone number and case number reflected 
on the borrower’s CAIVRS report.

•  Suspend processing of the loan application to determine the reason for 
the non “A” number.  
•  Give full consideration to the CAIVRS information, and any 
subsequent clarifying information or documentation provided, in 
applying VA credit standards.  Any non “A” number received does not 
automatically disqualify a Veteran from using their home loan benefit; 
however, the lender must document and justify the approval. See Topic 
7, subsection b of this chapter for documentation and explanation 
requirements. 
•  If a previous VA loan is involved that resulted in a debt to the 
government (due to foreclosures, short sale, deed in lieu, or other), the 
borrower may contact the VA Debt Management Center at 1-800-827-
0648 or at dmc.ops@va.gov to make arrangements to repay the debt. 
 
Generally, only type 2 VA loans (fifth digit of the VA loan number) result in a 
debt to VA and are reported.  The Veteran’s entitlement cannot be restored 
until the debt to VA is paid in full.

d. Borrower  If the fifth digit of the previous loan number is a type 6 VA loan, there is 
with Presently  generally a loss to the government and the loss is not reported to CAVIRS.   A

Each agency has their timeliness requirements before removing a non “A” 
CAVIRS finding.  This does not preclude the Veteran or borrower from 
receiving a VA loan if credit standards are met for VA loans.  See Topic 4.07b 
(13 and 14) of this Chapter for guidelines after a bankruptcy or foreclosure. 
 
Example:  A borrower suffered a loss on a FHA loan home loan 2 years ago.  
While HUD has not removed the CAIVRS finding as the 3-year waiting period 
has not passed for FHA, the lender is eligible to continue processing a VA 
loan without an “A” CAIVRS finding due to the borrower(s) meeting VA 
credit guidelines for foreclosures and documented in the loan file. 
 
CAIVRS information is only for the lender’s and borrower’s use in processing 
the loan application.  Only those persons having responsibility for screening 
borrowers and/or co-borrowers may use CAIVRS.  Any other use is 
unauthorized.

Federal Debts  presently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government until 
the delinquent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangement 
have been made between the borrower and the Federal agency. 
 
Example:  A borrower has delinquent taxes and payments have not been made 
for several years.  The establishment of a payment plan after the CAVIRS 
finding has been addressed may not be sufficient to show a satisfactory 
payment arrangement to repay the obligation. 
 
A borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she has a 
judgment lien against his or her property for a debt owed to the Government 
until the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied.

Change Date  February 22, 2019  
  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
 
Credit Reports used in analyzing VA loans must be either Three-file Merged 
a. Credit 
Credit Reports (MCR), or Residential Mortgage Credit Reports (RMCR). 
Report 
 
Standards 
The credit report must be less than 120-days old (180 days for new 
construction).  For automatically closed loans and prior approval loans, the 
date of the credit report must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed 
(180 days for new construction). 
 
If an RMCR is used, the standards applicable to a RMCR include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
 
•  The report must be prepared by a reputable credit reporting agency. 
•  Each account with a balance must have been checked with the creditor 
within 90 days of the date of the credit report. 
 
For each debt listed, the report must provide the creditor’s name, date the 
account was opened, high credit, current status, required payment, unpaid 
balance, and payment history. 
 
The report must name at least two national repositories of credit records 
contacted for each location in which the borrower has resided during the most 
recent 2 years (separate repository inquiries are required for any co-borrowers 
with individual credit records). 
 
The report must include all available public records information that is not 
considered obsolete under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681) 
such as bankruptcies, judgments, law suits, foreclosures and tax liens. 
 
The RMCR must be an original or electronic report, with no erasures, 
whiteouts, or alterations. 
 
The report must contain a 24-month employment and residency history. 
 
VA may decline to accept a credit report which does not meet these standards. 
 
If possible, the cost of the credit report must be listed on the credit report.  If 
not possible, an itemized invoice identifying the borrower(s) is required to 
verify the cost on the Closing Disclosure Statement (CD) when charging the 
borrower for the credit report.

b. How to  The borrower’s past repayment practices on obligations is the best indicator of 
Analyze Credit  his or her willingness to repay future obligations.  Emphasis should be on the 
borrower’s overall payment patterns rather than isolated occurrences of 
unsatisfactory repayment.  Determine whether the borrower (and spouse, if 
applicable) is a satisfactory credit risk based on a careful analysis of the credit 
report and other credit data. 
 
VA does not have a minimum credit score requirement.    
 
Rent and Mortgage Payment History 
 
The borrower’s most recent 24-month rental history and any outstanding, 
assumed, or recently retired mortgages must be verified and rated.  Housing 
expense payment history is often a primary indicator of how motivated the 
borrower is to make timely mortgage payments in the future.   
 
Absence of Credit History 
 
For borrower(s) with no established credit history, base the determination on 
the borrower’s payment record on alternative or nontraditional credit directly 
from the borrower or creditor in which a payment history can be verified.  
Absence of a credit history is not generally considered an adverse factor.   
 
It may result when: 
 
•  borrower(s) has not yet developed a credit history,  
•  borrower(s) has routinely used cash rather than credit, and/or 
•  borrower(s) has not used since some disruptive credit event such as 
bankruptcy or debt pro-ration through consumer credit counseling.

b. How to  Adverse Credit Data 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  In circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally 
considered to be re-established after the borrower(s), have made satisfactory 
payments for 12 months after the date the last derogatory credit item was 
satisfied.  If a credit report reveals numerous unpaid collections and/or 
accounts that are not being paid timely, including some which have been 
outstanding for many years, then once the borrower has satisfied the 
obligations, and then makes timely payments on subsequent obligations for at 
least 12 months, satisfactory credit is considered re-established.   
 
Collection Accounts 
 
Isolated collection accounts do not necessarily have to be paid off as a 
condition for loan approval.  A credit report may show numerous satisfactory 
accounts and one or two unpaid medical (or other) collections.  In such 
instances, while it would be preferable to have collections paid, it would not 
necessarily be a requirement for loan approval.   
 
However, collection accounts must be considered part of the borrower’s 
overall credit history and unpaid collection accounts should be considered 
open, recent credit.   
 
Borrowers with a history of collection accounts should have re-established 
satisfactory credit in order to be considered a satisfactory credit risk.   
 
While VA does not require that collection accounts be paid-off prior to closing 
if the borrower’s overall credit is acceptable, an underwriter must address the 
existence of the collection account(s) with an explanation on VA Form 26-
6393, Loan Analysis, for excluding the negative credit history they represent.    
 
If the collection account is listed on the credit report with a minimum 
payment, then the debt should be recognized at the minimum payment amount.

b. How to  Charged off Accounts 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  These accounts are typically collections in which the creditor is no longer 
pursuing collection of the account.  The underwriter must address the 
circumstances regarding the negative credit history when reviewing the overall 
credit of the borrower(s). 
 
Disputed Accounts 
 
Lenders may consider a Veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses 
regarding unpaid debts except when the debt has been reduced to judgment.   
 
The underwriter should document the reason(s) for not considering an account 
on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
Judgments 
 
Account balances reduced to judgment by a court must either be paid in full or 
subject to a repayment plan with a history of timely payments.   
 
A history of timely payments would be generally considered as making 12 
payments to reestablish credit.   
 
However, in certain cases when a judgment has only been in place for a few 
months, an underwriter could justify on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, a 
shorter repayment history if the documentation indicates the borrower 
immediately addressed the judgment after it was filed and began a repayment 
plan. 
 
Payoff of Unpaid or Untimely Debts 
 
For unpaid or debts that have not been paid timely, pay-off of these debts after 
the acceptability of a borrower's credit is questioned does not alter the 
unsatisfactory record of payment.  A period of making timely payments on 
subsequent obligations for at least 12 months, then satisfactory credit is 
considered re-established.

b. How to  Consumer Credit Counseling Plan 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  If a borrower(s) has prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer 
Credit Counseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk 
if they demonstrate 12 months’ satisfactory payments and the counseling 
agency approves the new credit. If a borrower(s) has good prior credit and are 
participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, such participation is to be 
considered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in determining 
creditworthiness.  Do not treat this as a negative credit item if the borrower 
entered the Consumer Credit Counseling plan before reaching the point of 
having bad credit. 
 
Bankruptcy 
 
The fact that a bankruptcy exists in a borrower (or spouse’s) credit history 
does not in itself disqualify the loan.  Develop complete information on the 
facts and circumstances of the bankruptcy.  Consider the reasons for the 
bankruptcy and the type of bankruptcy filing. 
 
Bankruptcy Filed Under the Straight Liquidation and Discharge 
Provisions of the Bankruptcy Law (Petition under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code): 
 
•  If the bankruptcy was discharged more than 2 years ago from the date 
of closing for purchases and refinances, it may be disregarded.   
•  If the bankruptcy was discharged within the last 1 to 2 years, it is 
probably not possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are 
met: 
 
Requirement  Explanation 
1  The borrower(s) had obtained consumer items on credit 
subsequent to the bankruptcy and has satisfactorily made 
the payments over a continued period. 
2  The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the 
control of the borrower or spouse such as unemployment, 
prolonged strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance, 
and so on, and the circumstances are verified.  Divorce is 
not generally viewed as beyond the control of the 
borrower and/or spouse.

continued   
If the bankruptcy was caused by failure of the business of a self-employed borrower, 
it may be possible to determine that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk if all 
four of the following are met: 
 
Requirement  Explanation 
1  The borrower obtained a permanent position after the 
business failed. 
2  There is not any derogatory credit information prior to the 
self-employment. 
3  There is not any derogatory credit information subsequent to 
the bankruptcy. 
4  Failure of the business was not due to the borrower’s 
misconduct. 
 
Bankruptcy Petition Under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code 
This type of filing indicates an effort to pay creditors.  Regular payments are made 
to a court-appointed trustee over a 2 to 3-year period or, in some cases, up to 5 
years, to pay off scaled down or entire debts. 
 
If the borrower(s) has finished making all payments satisfactorily, the lender may 
conclude that the borrower has re-established satisfactory credit. 
 
If the borrowers) has satisfactorily made at least 12 months’ worth of the payments 
and the Trustee or the Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit, the lender may 
give favorable consideration.

b. How to  Foreclosures 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  The fact that a home loan foreclosure (or deed-in-lieu or short sale in lieu of 
foreclosure) exists in a borrower(s) history does not in itself disqualify the loan.  
Develop complete information on the facts and circumstances of the 
foreclosure. 
 
You may disregard a foreclosure finalized more than 2 years from the date of 
closing. If the foreclosure was finalized within the last 1 to 2 years from the 
date of closing, it is probably not possible to determine that the borrower(s) is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are met: 
 
The borrower (s) has obtained consumer items on credit subsequent to the 
foreclosure and has satisfactorily made the payments over a continued period, 
and 
 
The foreclosure was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
borrower (s) such as unemployment; prolonged strikes, medical bills not 
covered by insurance, and so on, and the circumstances are verified.   
 
If a foreclosure, deed in lieu, or short sale process is in conjunction with a 
bankruptcy, use the latest date of either the discharge of the bankruptcy or 
transfer of title for the home to establish the beginning date of re-established 
credit.  If there is a significant delay in the transfer of title, the lender should 
contact the RLC of jurisdiction for guidance. 
 
Deed in lieu or short sale 
 
For a deed in lieu or short sale, develop complete information on the facts and 
circumstances in which the borrowers) voluntarily surrendered the property.  If 
the borrower’s payment history on the property was not affected before the 
short sale or deed in lieu and was voluntarily communicating with the servicer 
or holder, then a waiting period from the date transfer of the property may not 
be necessary. 
 
If the foreclosure, deed and lieu or short sale was on a VA-guaranteed loan, 
then a borrower may not have full entitlement available for the new VA loan.  
Ensure that the borrower’s COE reflects sufficient entitlement to meet any 
secondary marketing requirements of the lender.

VA has approved Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, Fannie Mae’s Desktop 
a. General AUS 
Underwriter, and VA approved proprietary lender AUS systems to use in 
Information 
connection with VA-guaranteed home loans.  These systems incorporate VA’s 
credit standards and processing requirements. 
 
Lenders may use certain reduced documentation requirements on cases 
processed with approved AUS.  The level of reduced documentation depends 
on the risk classification assigned.  The systems use different terminology such 
as Approve or Accept.  The tables in this section give a general description of 
documentation waivers.  Please note that the documentation requirements are 
the same for these cases as for non-AUS cases, except for any differences cited 
in the tables. 
 
The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely 
determine a risk classification.  It is still the lenders underwriter’s decision 
whether or not to approve the loan.   
 
Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor.  
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these systems. 
 
It is imperative that the data entered into the automated underwriting system 
be accurately verified.  The data utilized by the system must be supported by 
source documentation obtained by the lender.  Inaccurate or unverified data 
will result in invalidation of the risk classification.  Under certain 
circumstances, it could also result in a finding of material misrepresentation, 
which could affect the validity of the guaranty.   
 
b.  Because the AUS will be making the determination that the loan satisfies 
Underwriter’s  credit and income requirements, cases receiving an “Accept” or “Approve” 
Certification  rating will not require the underwriter’s signature on VA Form 26-6393, Loan 
Analysis (items 49 through 53).  However, the file must still contain the 
Lender’s Certification referenced in Chapter 5 of the VA Lender’s Handbook.

  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
   
 
 
a. General 
In order to properly enter information on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, 
the underwriter must understand and apply the guidelines provided in the 
preceding sections of this chapter.  
 
b. Estimated  Special instructions are listed in the following table: 
Monthly   
Shelter  Item  Special Instructions 
Expenses 
16  If taxes are expected to increase, use the increased amount. 
17  Include the flood insurance premium for properties located in 
special flood hazard areas. 
18  If special assessments are anticipated, use the anticipated 
amount. 
19  Calculate maintenance and utility costs using 14¢ per square 
foot for the gross living area as per the appraisal. 
 
Example:  A 1,500 square foot home with a 1,500 square foot 
unfished basement would have a combined maintenance and 
utility cost of $210 (1,500sq X .14). 
20  For condominiums or houses in a Planned Unit Development 
(PUD), include the monthly amount of maintenance 
assessment payable to the homeowner’s association.   
 
 
c. Debts and  List all known debts and obligations of the borrower and spouse including any 
Obligations  alimony and/or child support payments.  Spousal support or alimony may be 
treated as a reduction in income; however, child support is to be treated as a 
liability. 
 
Place a check mark in the (3) column next to any “significant” debt or 
obligation.  See the topic “Analysis of Debts and Obligations” in Topic 4.05c 
of this chapter, for an explanation of “significant.” 
 
Job Related Expense – Section D line 29. 
 
Include any costs for child care, significant commuting costs, and any other 
direct or incidental costs associated with the borrower’s (or spouse’s) 
employment.  Check this item if total job-related expenses are significant.

e. Balance  Examples 
Available for   
Family  A Veteran has a family size of 3 purchasing a home in Arizona with a loan 
Support-      
amount of $400,000.  The residual figure will be $990. 
Item 43, 
 
continued 
A Veteran has a family size of 8 purchasing a home in Georgia with a loan 
amount of $150,000.  The residual figure will be $1,199 (family size of 5 
which is $1,039 adding $80 for each additional family member up to a family 
size of 7).  The eighth person will not be considered in the calculation. 
 
Special Instructions   
 
Count all members of the household (without regard to the nature of the 
relationship) when determining “family size,” including: 
 
•  A borrower’s spouse who is not joining in title or on the note, and 
•  Any other individuals who depend on the borrower for support.  
 
If a dependent is claimed on the Federal Tax Returns, then the dependent must 
be considered as a member of the household, to calculate residual income. 
 
Examples 
 
•  Children from a spouse’s prior marriage who are not the borrower’s 
legal dependents. 
•  A dependent parent.  
 
Exceptions for Considering All Members of the Household 
 
The lender may omit any individuals from “family size” who are fully 
supported from a source of verified income which, for whatever reason, is not 
included in effective income in the loan analysis.   
 
Examples 
 
•  a spouse not obligated on the title or on the note that has stable and 
reliable income sufficient to support his or her living expenses. 
•  a child for whom sufficient foster care payments or child support is 
received regularly, or 
•  a parent who has sufficient stable and reliable non-taxable income.

e. Balance  Reducing the Residual Income Figures 
Available for   
Family  Reduce the residual income figure (from the above tables) by five percent if: 
Support-      
 
Item 43, 
• the borrower(s) is an active duty or retired serviceperson, or 
continued 
• there is a clear indication that a borrower will receive the benefits resulting 
from use of military-based facilities located near the property.  Examples 
include Guard and Reserve military retirees, 100 percent disabled Veterans 
and their family members, or Medal of Honor recipients. 
 
f. Debt-to- VA’s debt-to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
Income Ratio,  expense, installment debts, and other debt) to gross monthly income.  The 
Item 44  following steps are required to determine the debt-to-income ratio: 
 
Step  Description 
1  Add: Items 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 +20 +40 = Debt 
2  Add:  Items 31 + 38* = Income 
3  Divide:  Debt * Income = Debt-to-Income Ratio 
4  Round:  To the nearest two digits 
 
The “Debt-to-Income Ratio” heading in Topic 10, subsection b of this chapter 
contains special procedures to apply if the ratio exceeds 41 percent. 
 
Only the borrower's actual income may be used to calculate the residual 
income.   
 
Care should be exercised to ensure that the income considered tax-exempt is 
likely to continue and remain untaxed.   
 
Tax-free income includes certain military allowances, child support payments, 
workers’ compensation benefits, disability retirement payments, and certain 
types of public assistance payments.   
                                                                                  Continued on next page

f. Debt-to- Verify that the income is indeed tax-free before “grossing up.”   
Income Ratio,   
Item 44,  Tax-free income may be “grossed up” for purposes of calculating the debt-to-
continued 
income ratio only. 
 
•  This is a tool that may be used to lower the debt ratio for borrowers 
who clearly qualify for the loan.   
•  “Grossing up” involves adjusting the income upward to a pre-tax or 
gross income amount which, after deducting state and Federal income 
taxes, equals the tax-exempt income.   
•  Use current IRS and state income tax withholding tables to determine 
an amount which can be prudently employed to adjust the borrower’s 
actual income. Use a figure of 125 percent of the borrower’s non-
taxable income when “grossing up.” 
•  Do not add non-taxable income to taxable income before “grossing 
up.” 
•  If “grossing up” is used, indicate such and provide the “grossed up” 
ratio of 125 percent in item 47, “Remarks.” The actual amounts of the 
borrower’s non-taxable income should not be adjusted in in line 38. 
 
g. Past Credit  Indicate whether the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) is a satisfactory or 
Record-       unsatisfactory credit risk based on a complete analysis of credit data.

  VA’s minimum residual incomes (balance available for family support) are a

Income 
Instead, consider residual income in conjunction with all other credit factors. 
 
However, an inadequate residual income alone can be a basis for disapproving 
a loan.   
 
If residual income is marginal, look to other indicators such as the borrower’s 
credit history, and in particular, whether and how the borrower has previously 
handled similar housing expense. 
 
Consider the ages of the borrower’s dependents in determining the adequacy 
of residual income. 
 
b. Debt-to  VA’s debt-to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
Income Ratio  expense, installment debts, and other obligations listed in section D of VA 
Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, to gross monthly income.  It is a guide and, as 
an underwriting factor, it is secondary to the residual income.  It should not 
automatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan.  Instead, consider the 
ratio in conjunction with all other credit factors. 
 
A ratio greater than 41 percent requires close scrutiny unless: 
 
•  the ratio is greater than 41 percent unless it is larger due solely to the 
existence of tax-free income which should be noted in the loan file), 
the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's 
supervisor, or 
•  residual income exceeds the guideline by at least 20 percent. 
 
Loans closed automatically with a debt-to-income ratio greater than 41 
percent: 
 
•  Include a statement justifying the reasons for approval, signed by the 
underwriter’s supervisor, unless residual income exceeds the guideline 
by at least 20 percent. 
•  The statement must include the reason(s) for approving the loan and 
list the compensating factors justifying approval of the loan.

Compensating  especially important when reviewing loans which are marginal with respect to 
Factors  residual income or debt-to-income ratio.  They cannot be used to compensate 
for unsatisfactory credit.   
 
Valid compensating factors should represent strengths rather than mere 
satisfaction of basic program requirements.  For example, the fact that a 
borrower has sufficient assets for closing purposes, or meets the residual 
income guideline, is not a compensating factor. 
 
Valid compensating factors should logically be able to compensate (to some 
extent) for the identified weakness in the loan.  For example, significant liquid 
assets may compensate for a residual income shortfall whereas long-term 
employment would not. 
 
Compensating factors include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
• excellent credit history, 
• conservative use of consumer credit, 
• minimal consumer debt, 
• long-term employment, 
• significant liquid assets, 
• sizable downpayment, 
• the existence of equity in refinancing loans, 
• little or no increase in shelter expense, 
• military benefits, 
• satisfactory homeownership experience, 
• high residual income, 
• low debt-to-income ratio, 
• tax credits for child care, and  
• tax benefits of home ownership

Proposed  Consider the:

• ability of the borrower to accumulate liquid assets, and  
• amount of debts incurred while paying a less amount for shelter. 
 
If a borrower’s application shows little or no reserves and excessive 
obligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in 
shelter expenses can be absorbed.  
 
f. Home  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, many 
Mortgage  lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate 
Disclosure Act  measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to home 
(HMDA) 
mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be aware of 
how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in meeting this 
goal. 
 
Compatibility of VA Program with HMDA 
 
The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for 
individuals with low-to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such borrowers.  VA Credit Standards are written as guidelines and are 
meant to be interpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration all of 
an individual loan borrower’s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.   
 
Purpose of HMDA 
 
VA encourages underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which 
ought to be approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of 
the credit standards.   
 
Underwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications for 
every qualified Veteran.

1. Processing Procedures 
 
Change Date  April 1, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Order of  The procedures discussed in this topic must be initiated and may be completed 
Completion  in any feasible order, with the exception of the Certificate of Eligibility 
(COE), as long as they are all completed prior to loan closing.  The COE must 
be obtained prior to ordering an appraisal.  These procedures apply to both 
prior approval loans and loans closed automatically (except the procedure 
which specifically refers to prior approval loans). 
 
To avoid delays in closing, it is recommended that the lender take the 
following actions in the very early stages of loan processing: 
 
  obtain a COE (see subsection b of this chapter), 
  request an appraisal assignment in VA’s web-based loan guaranty 
system (WebLGY), (see Chapter 10 of this handbook for the steps to 
order an appraisal), 
  initiate the Credit Alert Verification Report System (CAIVRS) and, if 
applicable, a complete VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA Benefits, 
(see Topic 6, Chapter 4 of the Lender’s Handbook), 
  request a credit report and verifications (see Topic 7, Chapter 4 of this 
handbook). 
 
b.  How to  Verify the Veteran’s or surviving spouse’s eligibility for home loan benefits 
Obtain a  and amount of available entitlement by obtaining a COE in WebLGY.  It is 
Certificate of  highly suggested that lenders obtain a COE online through WebLGY for the 
Eligibility 
most efficient processing times.  Veterans may also apply online through 
eBenefits. A COE obtained by the borrower in eBenefits will be in WebLGY.  
This COE can be accessed by the lender using at least two of the requested 
data points in the system, for example the reference number and Veteran’s 
social security number.  An additional or updated COE does not need to be 
obtained or updated unless a change needs to be made to the COE.  Please 
examine and understand the conditions of the COE. Failure to comply with 
the COE conditions may result in an ineligible loan (see Chapter 2 of this 
handbook).

f. Requirements  Ensure every active duty Servicemember who applies for a loan is 
for Active Duty  counseled through the use of VA Form 26-0592, Counseling Checklist for 
Servicemembers  Military Homebuyers, as early as possible in the transaction. 
 
The active duty Veteran’s and lender’s signature on the form signifies 
counseling has been completed. 
 
Ensure the Veteran, eligible as an active duty member, is still on active duty 
at the time of closing if the COE indicates: “Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of continuous 
active duty as of the date of note is required.”  If the lender becomes aware 
that the applicant is no longer on active duty, the loan may not be closed 
unless VA re-establishes the Veteran’s eligibility as follows: 
 
  A Veteran released from active duty must have a DD214 Form 
(member copy 4) with time served, Character of Service Discharge, 
and reason for the discharge listed. It must be uploaded into 
WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
  A Veteran released from the National Guard or Reserves must have 
evidence of time served and an Honorable discharge. This must be 
uploaded into WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
  If a COE was issued based upon active duty service and the Veteran 
has been separated, eligibility must be re-determined based upon 
their length of service and character of service.   
 
g.  Obtain a  Upload to WebLGY all prior approval loans for review (see Topic 4 of this

  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  Loans to be  Lenders without automatic authority are strongly encouraged to enter into a 
Submitted for  sponsor/agent relationship with a VA-approved automatic lender to expedite 
Prior Approval  VA loan processing and underwriting.  If a lender does not have a sponsor, 
then they must submit an application to VA for prior approval lending.  Those 
without sponsors or automatic authority must upload all loans into WebLGY 
for prior approval, except IRRRLs made to refinance loans that are not 
delinquent (see Chapter 1 of this handbook).  
 
Lenders must upload all prior approval documents into WebLGY, for RLC 
review (see Subsection c of this Topic).  A user’s guide for uploading prior 
approval loans is available online at 
http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/documents/docs/prior_approval_LP_le
nders.pdf. 
 
All lenders, whether or not they have automatic authority, must submit the 
following types of loans to VA for prior approval: 
 
  joint loans, except Veteran-Veteran as a married couple (see Chapter 7 
of this handbook) 
  loans to Veteran in receipt of VA nonservice-connected pension.  This 
is not the same as VA disability – income based (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
  loans to Veterans who have a VA Fiduciary (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
  IRRRLs made to refinance delinquent loans (See Chapter 6 of this 
handbook) 
  manufactured home loans (home is not titled as real-estate) 
  supplemental loans 
 
Note:  COEs may indicate to submit VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA 
Benefits.  The form is completed by the VA RLC of jurisdiction where the 
property is located, and will indicate whether the Veteran receives VA non-
service connected pension or has a VA Fiduciary.  For a list of all VA offices 
and their jurisdictions visit

However, the underwriter must first attempt to contact the VA RLC of 
 
jurisdiction of where the property is located to discuss the circumstances with a 
Loan Specialist.   
 
 
  While VA cannot make the final underwriting determination without reviewing 
the loan, the VA RLC can discuss VA guidelines found in this handbook to 
  assist the underwriter in making a determination.   
 
 
VA cannot address overlays established by a company or investor and the loan 
should not be submitted as a prior approval for the lender to overcome any 
 
company or investor requirements. 
 
 
The lender must furnish a cover letter with the uploaded file that states the 
  reason(s) for the prior approval submission and explains any unique 
circumstances.  In addition, the cover letter must include the submitting 
  underwriter’s name, phone number, e-mail address and his or her manager’s 
name, phone number, and e-mail address. 
 
 
 Do not use this provision to shift the burden of a loan denial to VA.

VA will review the documents submitted and complete the following: 
f. VA 
Processing of a   
Prior Approval    suspend processing and request additional information from the lender. 
Application    send a notice of denial to the lender and borrower, or  
  issue VA’s certificate of commitment to the lender, which is evidence 
 
of VA’s approval of the loan to close and willingness to guaranty the 
loan. 
 
Loans submitted on the prior approval basis have a 10-business day timeliness 
requirement by VA. 
The processing time may be extended for loans involving the receipt of VA 
pension income or a Veteran with a VA Fiduciary. Either the VA Pension or 
Fiduciary HUB may have, in addition to Loan Guaranty, to provide a review 
of the loan file. 
   
VA‘s certificate of commitment must be obtained prior to closing and is the 
g. Certificate of 
Commitment  lender’s evidence of VA’s willingness to guaranty the loan.  The lender is 
subsequently entitled to evidence of guaranty if the: 
   
  the closed loan is identical in all respects to that submitted to VA on 
the URLA and described on the certificate of commitment (or, if not 
identical, any required VA approval of changes was obtained prior to 
closing), and 
  the lender has complied with all applicable provisions of the law and 
loan guaranty regulations in making the loan.  Additionally, all 
conditions of the certificate of commitment must be met. 
 
If, at any time prior to closing, the lender or VA has reason to doubt the 
continued qualification of the loan, the lender will delay closing until all facts 
are determined and reviewed again by VA. 
 
VA may cancel a commitment if the validity period of the certificate of 
commitment has expired (after 180 days), and there is no reasonable 
expectation that the loan will be reported for guaranty.   
 
A commitment may be extended under certain circumstances.  Contact the 
VA office of jurisdiction of where the property is located for a review of the 
prior approval commitment.

Change Date  April 1, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  General  If you are not the loan servicer or holder of the current VA loan, please refer 
Information  the borrower or purchaser to the servicer or holder of the current VA loan for 
processing.  Assumptions can only be processed and closed by loan holders 
and services with VA automatic authority that are holding or servicing the 
current VA loan.   
 
Loan holders or servicers holding the loan without VA automatic authority 
that are holding or servicing the current VA loan, may submit a prior approval 
package to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located. See 
Topic 1 of this chapter.  
 
A VA assumption is also considered a Release of Liability (ROL).  
 
Properties that are security for VA-guaranteed loans may be disposed or 
transferred even though the loans are not paid in full. Veterans who dispose or 
transfer their properties under these conditions remain liable to VA for any 
loss that may occur as a result of a future default and subsequent claim 
payment, unless the property is transferred to a creditworthy purchaser who 
agrees to assume the payment obligation.  The servicer initially determines the 
purchaser’s creditworthiness.

a. General  Any purchaser may qualify to assume a VA loan; however, for a Veteran’s 
Information,  entitlement to be restored, a Veteran purchaser with sufficient entitlement 
continued  must complete a Substitution of Entitlement (SOE) when the ROL is closed.  
The Veteran’s entitlement is not restored unless the Veteran purchaser, in 
addition to assuming the payment obligation, also agrees and is eligible to 
substitute their entitlement for the Veteran seller’s entitlement. It is important 
for the servicer as soon as possible in the assumption process to obtain COEs 
for both the Veteran assumer and Veteran seller to determine if there is 
sufficient entitlement in which to substitute. See chapter 3 of this handbook. 
 
Unless the ROL is an unrestricted transfer, a closing disclosure is required.  
 
An ROL or SOE does not affect the original issuance of the LGC. 
 
 
b.  Who Can  While procedures for processing requests for assumption approvals previously 
Process Loan  depended on the date of loan (commitment made on or after March 1, 1988), 
Assumptions?    the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) regulations authorize 
loan holders or servicers with automatic authority that are holding or servicing 
the current VA loan to be transferred to determine creditworthiness on all 
assumption approval requests processed by their servicers. 
 
c.  Servicers  Servicers with automatic authority are authorized to process and determine 
with Automatic  creditworthiness on assumption approval requests on behalf of VA.  Servicers 
Authority  must follow VA underwriting guidelines (see chapter 4 of this handbook) 
when processing and determining creditworthiness on these cases. 
   
Servicers must notify VA electronically of authorized ownership transfers and 
approved ROLs in VALERI.  Additional information on the reporting process 
is available online at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/valeri.asp. 
 
An underwriting and closing package must be uploaded into WebLGY, for the 
existing VA loan number.

A seller must apply for approval of the transfer prior to completing the sale.   
 
Servicers and holders with automatic authority must examine the application

the determination in a case where neither the servicer nor the holder has 
automatic authority, following receipt of a complete application package from 
the servicer or holder.

f.  Approval  To approve the transfer of ownership: 
Requirements   
  the loan must be current or will be brought current at the closing of 
the sales transaction, 
  the prospective purchaser of the property is creditworthy, as 
determined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and Chapter 4 of 
the Lender’s Handbook, and 
  the prospective purchaser has agreed to assume all of the loan 
obligations, including the obligation to indemnify VA if a claim is 
paid. 
 
A processing fee may be collected in advance, including a reasonable 
estimate for the cost of the credit report.  The maximum fee for processing a 
request for assumption approval and changing the loan records is the lesser 
of: 
 
  automatic authority – $300 plus the actual cost of a credit report; or 
  no automatic authority – $250 plus the actual cost of a credit report; 
or 
  any maximum prescribed by applicable state law. 
 
VA does not specifically regulate when the processing fee may be assessed.  
However, when the processing fee is collected prior to signing the sales 
contract, the portion of the fee attributable to changing the servicer’s records 
(usually $50) must be returned to the seller if the application is denied or the 
process is not completed.  Therefore, VA recommends that the processing 
charge accompany the complete package.

h.  Decision  Approvals: If the application for ownership transfer is approved, the servicer 
Notices  must notify the seller and include instructions for the assumption of liability 
by the purchaser, the amount of funding fee that must be paid, and 
documentation needed to complete the process. 
 
Disapprovals: If the application is disapproved, the seller and purchaser must

  contact information of the servicer including address, phone number, 
and e-mail of the servicer for VA to request the underwriting package

i.  VA Appeals  The seller or the purchaser may appeal a disapproval decision to the VA 
RLC with jurisdiction over where the property is located within 30 calendar 
days from the notification of disapproval.  
 
When the VA RLC receives an appeal of a denied request, VA will request 
that the servicer send a copy of the application package used in making the 
decision.   
 
The loan package must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction of where 
the property is located within 7 calendar days.  
 
The VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located will review and 
either approve the assumption on appeal or uphold the decision to deny the

i.  VA Appeals,  VA’s special approval does not release any obligor from liability. VA may 
continued   determine that special approval of the assumption is in the best interest of the 
government if: 
 
  the seller agrees to remain secondarily liable on the loan following 
assumption, 
  the seller is unable to otherwise continue payments on the loan, and 
reasonable efforts have been made to find a creditworthy borrower 
for the property, or 
  if an obligor is released without proper approval, VA may be released 
from further liability on the guaranty. 
 
VA has 7 calendar days from receipt of the seller’s request to make this 
determination.   
 
If approved, the VA RLC will notify the servicer and seller that the 
assumption has been approved and that the seller will not be released from 
liability to VA; however, the property can be transferred to the purchaser(s). 
The servicer should close the assumption with 30 days of VA’s special 
approval. 
 
If disapproved, the VA RLC will notify the seller and lender that the 
assumption has not been approved, that the seller will not be released 
from liability, and the property cannot be transferred. 
 
j.  Steps After  Once approved, the servicer will complete the transfer with a loan

requirements.

k. Assumption  The VA-approved assumption clause must be included in the deed 
Clause  conveying the property to the purchaser.  The VA RLC of jurisdiction 
of where the property is located has an example(s) of assumption 
clauses that are both acceptable to VA and compliant with state and 
local requirements.  
 
Servicers should contact the RLC of jurisdiction of where the property 
is located to obtain sample language and/or documents.  
 
The servicer is responsible for reviewing the document to establish that 
it contains the approved assumption clause and recording data and that 
it has the legal effect intended. 
 
 
l.  Agreement  If the seller and purchaser have satisfied all the requirements of 38 
Creating  U.S.C. 3714(a)(1), but the transfer deed containing an acceptable 
Liability  assumption clause was not included, the servicer must prepare an 
“Agreement Creating Liability to Holder and to United States” to 
execute the release. 
 
The servicer must prepare an Agreement Creating Liability to Holder 
and to “United States” to execute the release.  
 
Three copies are needed for execution and must be signed by the: 
 
  seller, 
  purchaser, and 
  servicer as agent for the Department of Veteran Affairs. 
 
The VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located has

Once received, the servicer is responsible for reviewing the document to 
establish that it was properly completed and that it has the legal effect

The holder or its authorized servicing agent will then execute the release 
portion of the form.  
 
In those states where recording the assumption and/or the release 
instrument is necessary, the Veteran may be asked to pay the recording 
fees. 
 
m.  Funding  At loan transfer, the purchaser is required to pay a funding fee to the 
Fee    servicer equal to one-half of one percent of the loan balance as of the date 
of transfer. 
 
See Chapter 8 of this handbook for information on other exemptions from 
the funding fee and how to verify exemption status. 
 
When the transfer is a result of an unrestricted transfer, a funding fee is 
not required.   
 
The fee must be paid to VA within 15 calendar days of the date of 
assumption using the VA Funding Fee Payment System – VA FFPS . 
 
The VA funding fee cannot be financed into the loan being assumed.  It 
must be paid in cash at the time of transfer. 
 
n.  Notification  Servicers must notify VA after ownership has been transferred and release

Servicers are required to retain the supporting documentation for all 
transfers, assumptions, and an ROL for at least 3 years from approval or 
denial.  
 
o.  Assumptions  Servicers must notify VA’s Loan Production Department at the RLC of 
without Prior  jurisdiction of where the property is located (in addition to the VALERI 
Approval  system) within 60 days after learning of a transfer that did not receive prior 
approval by the servicer or VA.  
 
The notice must advise VA whether the servicer intends to exercise the 
option to immediately refer the case to foreclosure or to give the transferor 
and transferee the opportunity to apply for “retroactive approval” of the 
assumption. 
 
Upon learning of an unapproved transfer, the servicer may decide to demand 
immediate payment of the one-half of one percent VA funding fee and 
request a copy of the instrument of transfer to determine the liability of the 
purchaser. 
 
Loans for which a commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988, are 
commonly known as freely assumable loans.  Owners have the right to sell 
the property securing these loans under any terms; servicers may not impose 
a restriction, charge, or fee that would limit or nullify this right.  A funding 
fee is not assessed on assumptions of loans where the commitment was made 
prior to March 1, 1988.

o.  Assumptions  Liability assumed.  The purchaser should be afforded an opportunity for

Approval,   
continued 
  the purchaser pays the funding fee, 
  the purchaser has assumed all of the seller’s obligations in the 
transfer deed, 
  the assumption language is legally binding, and  
  it appears that the purchaser intends to satisfy those obligations. 
 
When these conditions have been met, then the Veteran and transferee 
must specifically apply for an ROL under 38 U.S.C. 3713.  See 
subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the original Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect the guaranty on the loan. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for a 
Substitution of Entitlement to restore the Veteran seller’s entitlement 
(see subsection r of this topic). 
 
 Liability not assumed.  If prior approval of a transfer was not 
obtained and the title was transferred “subject to” the mortgage or 
deed of trust, then the purchaser usually has no liability on the loan 
and no liability for the funding fee. In this instance, the purchaser 
may have no incentive to maintain the payments.

Approval,  to guaranty the loan. 
continued  
 
It may still be advisable to extend the opportunity to apply for 
retroactive approval of the transfer, with the expectation that the 
purchaser will assume liability for repayment of the loan. 
 
The original mortgagor remains liable on the loan unless he or she is 
released from personal liability with a qualifying assumption.  The 
Veteran and transferee must specifically apply for an ROL under 38 
U.S.C. 3713.  See subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the original Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect the guaranty on the loan. The LGC 
remains in the original Veteran’s name. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for an 
SOE to restore the Veteran seller’s entitlement. See subsection r of 
this topic. 
 
An exception applies when the loan was made by a state, territorial, 
or local governmental agency and the law requires acceleration of the 
maturity of the loan upon sale or transfer of the property to a person 
not eligible for assistance under the special program.  VA has 
approved due-on-sale clauses to allow Veterans to participate in these 
programs and take advantage of below-market interest rates and 
benefits.

had been received prior to the transfer.  This includes the right of 
appeal to VA, if the request is denied. 
 
Should a purchaser fail to cooperate in the retroactive approval 
process, a servicer has the option of accelerating the loan.   
 
When making this decision, the servicer should consider the 
implications of state law when delaying acceleration as compared to 
the prospect of accelerating a current loan that has the potential for 
future timely payments. 
 
Any decision must be reported to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of the 
property and in VALERI.

Divorce, 
appeal will be taken, or 
continued 
  a signed separation agreement by all parties based on 
local laws and available documents with reasons why a 
separation agreement is used in lieu of a final decree of 
divorce, and  
  the entire estate encumbered for the VA-guaranteed 
loan has become vested in the name of the Veteran’s 
former  spouse, and 
  there is not any knowledge of any property settlement 
that would make the Veteran liable between the parties 
to pay the guaranteed loan. 
 
Some states require a specific amount of time between a legal 
separation and a divorce (up to one year).  With proper 
documentation, do not delay the request for an ROL, if the divorce is 
not final, but a legal separation agreement is in effect. 
 
In some instances, the ex-spouse may also be a Veteran; however, for 
VA purposes, only the applicant who used their entitlement to 
guaranty the loan is considered a Veteran.   
 
For example, John and Mary Doe are divorcing and both have 
obtained a COE; however, only John’s COE was used to guarantee 
the loan.  Since Mary’s COE was not used to guarantee the home, 
only John is considered the Veteran.  If Mary wishes to assume the 
loan, a credit qualifying package is required for an ROL and Mary 
can substitute her entitlement with the assumption. 
 
When the Veteran is awarded the property, the ex-spouse may seek an 
ROL.

The servicer will be provided a with an NVS letter indicating VA has 
released the non-Veteran spouse of liability. 
 
The servicer may only charge a fee of $50 for amending its records to 
reflect the change. 
 
 It is not necessary for the servicer to complete an ROL. 
 
For example, Mary and Jon Smith divorced after they purchased a 
home using Mary’s COE.  She obtains the home per the divorce 
decree.  Since she is the Veteran and will be retaining the property, 
she will contact the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is 
located to process the NVS. 
   
r.  Substitution  A Veteran may allow an assumption/ROL of his or her VA-
of Entitlement  guaranteed loan with the expectation of being able to have his or her 
entitlement restored.  A restoration may be needed to obtain another 
VA-guaranteed loan in the future by restoring the previously used 
entitlement for full entitlement benefits.  Entitlement cannot be 
restored until VA makes a determination of eligibility for the Veteran 
assumer and Veteran seller and processes the SOE.  VA completes the 
SOE process after a servicer closes the assumption and issues an 
ROL.  Questions about an SOE should be directed to the VA RLC 
with jurisdiction where the property is located. 
 
It is important for the servicer to obtain a COE as soon as possible in 
the assumption process to determine if there is sufficient entitlement 
for the Veteran assumer to complete the SOE for the Veteran seller.  
Entitlement must be of equal amounts to substitute.  See Chapter 3 of 
this handbook for determination of home loan eligibility.

r.  Substitution  When a Veteran requests approval for a transfer of ownership, he or 
of Entitlement,  she may request to have entitlement restored for use on another VA 
continued   loan. For VA to approve such a request: 
 
  the assumption (ROL) must be completed and closed by the lender; 
  the purchaser must be an eligible Veteran who has sufficient 
entitlement to substitute for that of the original Veteran; 
  the purchaser must certify that the property securing the loan will be 
occupied as his or her residence; 
  the purchasing Veteran must agree to the SOE; and 
  there must be equal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran 
in order to substitute his or her entitlement with the Veteran being 
released of their entitlement. 
 
The assumption (ROL) must be completed and closed by the lender. 
 
The purchaser must be an eligible Veteran who has sufficient 
entitlement to substitute for that of the original Veteran. 
 
The purchaser must certify that the property securing the loan will be 
occupied as his or her residence. 
 
The purchasing Veteran must agree to the SOE, and there must be 
equal available entitlement from the assuming Veteran in order to 
substitute his or her entitlement with the Veteran being released of 
their entitlement. 
 
Whenever two Veterans intend to follow the SOE process, the 
servicer should have the Veteran purchaser complete VA Form 26-
8106, Statement of Veteran Assuming GI Loan, (Substitution of 
entitlement).  It should be included in the closing package submitted 
to VA. 
 
A COE for each Veteran should accompany the credit package used 
to approve the ROL. 
 
It is important to verify the purchasing Veteran has sufficient 
entitlement, is willing to substitute their entitlement, and will meet 
occupancy requirements to substitute before the closing of the ROL to 
meet the requirements of an SOE.

Servicers must report unrestricted transfers to VA through VALERI 
as authorized transfers of ownership, which will typically be handled 
automatically by their servicing systems.   
 
Unrestricted transfers of ownership include: 
 
  the creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the 
lender’s security instrument that does not relate to a transfer of 
rights of occupancy in the property; 
  the creation of a purchase money security interest for 
household appliances; 
  a transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death 
of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety; 
  the granting of a leasehold interest of 3 years or less not 
containing an option to purchase; 
  a transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;  
  a transfer when the spouse or child of the borrower becomes a 
joint owner of the property with the borrower,  
  a transfer into an inter-vivos trust in which the borrower is and 
remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer 
of rights of occupancy in the property; and 
  a transfer resulting from a decree to dissolve a marriage, legal 
separation agreement, or from an incidental property 
settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower 
becomes the sole owner of the property.

are not subject to 38 U.S.C. 3714. 
 
These sale agreements do not require prior approval from the servicer 
or VA. 
 
 
Borrowers inquiring should be cautioned that any borrower 
considering a sale in this manner would remain liable for repayment of 
the loan under such an arrangement.

Depending on the circumstances of a case, servicers may agree to 
change the account address to read “in care of” the contract purchaser, 
although the contract seller must promptly advise the servicer of any 
change in his or her address. 
 
Sales by installment contracts typically call for transfer of title after a 
certain period of time. 
 
If the contract calls for title to transfer prior to payment in full of the 
VA loan, VA requires assumption approval according to the 
procedures previously discussed. 
 
Processing charges and VA funding fees will be applicable upon 
transfer. 
 
As one of the conditions of the contract, servicers should advise the 
borrower that the language stating an application for assumption 
approval will be made, and approval secured, prior to the completion 
of title transfer. 
 
The contract should address the options of both parties if the request 
for assumption approval is denied. 
 
Servicers are required to retain the supporting documentation for all 
transfers, assumptions, and releases of liability for at least 3 years 
from approval or denial.  
 
An assumption package should be submitted to the RLC of 
jurisdiction of where the property is located.

Change Date  April 10, 2009, Change 11 
 This section has been changed to update hyperlinks and to make minor 
grammatical edits. 
  
a. What is an  An IRRRL is a VA-guaranteed loan made to refinance an existing VA-
IRRRL?  guaranteed loan, generally at a lower interest rate than the existing VA loan, 
and with lower principal and interest payments than the existing VA loan.    
 
Generally, no appraisal, credit information or underwriting is required on an 
IRRRL, and any lender may close an IRRRL automatically.   
 
Note: Exceptions and specific requirements are explained in the remainder of 
this section. 
  
b. Interest Rate  An IRRRL (which can be a fixed rate, hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage 
Decrease  (ARM) or traditional ARM) must bear a lower interest rate than the loan it is 
Requirement  refinancing unless the loan it is refinancing is an ARM. 
 
c. Payment  The principal and interest payment on an IRRRL must be less than the 
Decrease/  principal and interest payment on the loan being refinanced unless one of the 
Increase  following exceptions applies: 
Requirements 
 
 the IRRRL is refinancing an ARM, 
 term of the IRRRL is shorter than the term of the loan being refinanced, or 
 energy efficiency improvements are included in the IRRRL. 
 
A significant increase in the veteran’s monthly payment may occur with any 
of these three exceptions, especially if combined with one or more of the 
following: 
 
 financing of closing costs, 
 financing of up to two discount points,  
 financing of the funding fee, and/or 
 higher interest rate when an ARM is being refinanced.

c. Payment  If the monthly payment (PITI) increases by 20 percent or more, the lender 
Decrease/  must: 
Increase   
Requirements 
 determine that the veteran qualifies for the new payment from an 
(continued) 
underwriting standpoint; such as, determine whether the borrower can 
support the proposed shelter expense and other recurring monthly 
obligations in light of income established as stable and reliable, and  
 include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceeds the previous payment by 20 percent or more. 
 
d. Veteran’s  For all IRRRLs, the veteran must sign a statement acknowledging the effect 
Statement and  of the refinancing loan on the veteran’s loan payments and interest rate.  
Lender’s   
Certification 
The statement must show the interest rate and monthly payments for the new 
loan versus that for the old loan.  The statement must also indicate how long it 
would take to recoup ALL closing costs (both those included in the loan and 
those paid outside of closing).   
 
If the monthly payment (PITI) increases by 20 percent or more, the lender 
must include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceeds the previous payment by 20 percent or more. 
 
Example:   
 
 Vet’s monthly payment decreases by $50.00. 
 Vet pays $5,000 in closing costs (includes all costs – closing costs, funding 
fee, discounts, etc). 
 Recoup closing costs in 100 months - $5,000 divided by $50.  
 
Note:  This would not be required in those limited cases where the payment is 
not decreasing (reduced term of loan, etc.). 
 
The veteran’s statement may be combined with the lender’s certification and 
should be on the lender’s own letterhead.  For a sample please go to:

e. What Closing  The following fees and charges may be included in an IRRRL: 
Costs can be   
Included in the   the VA funding fee, and 
Loan? 
 any allowable fees and charges discussed in section 2 of chapter 8; such as, 
all allowable closing costs, including the lender’s flat charge. 
 
However, There Is One Limitation 
While the borrower may pay any reasonable amount of discount points in 
cash, only up to two discount points can be included in the loan amount. 
 
Although VA does not require an appraisal or credit underwriting on 
IRRRLs, any customary and reasonable credit report or appraisal expense 
incurred by a lender to satisfy its lending requirements may be charged to the 
borrower and included in the loan. 
 
The lender may also set the interest rate on the new loan high enough to 
enable the lender to pay all closing costs, as long as the requirements for 
lower interest rate and payments (or one of the exceptions to those 
requirements) are met. 
 
For IRRRLs to refinance loans 30 days or more past due (which must be 
submitted for prior approval), the following can be included in the new loan: 
 
 late payments and late charges on the old loan, and 
 reasonable costs if legal action to terminate the old loan has commenced. 
 
f. When Can  An IRRRL cannot be used to take equity out of the property or pay off debts,

Closing? 
IRRRL.  Therefore, the general rule is that the borrower cannot receive cash 
proceeds from the loan.  If necessary, the refinancing loan amount must be 
rounded down to avoid payments of cash to the veteran. 
 
The one exception is reimbursement of the veteran for the cost of energy 
efficiency improvements up to $6,000 completed within the 90 days 
immediately preceding the date of loan closing.

Receive Cash at  7. 
Closing? 
 
(continued) 
In a limited number of situations, the borrower may receive cash at closing.  
Some examples of situations in which VA does not object to the borrower 
receiving cash are: 
 
 computational errors, 
 changes in final pay-off figures, 
 up-front fees paid for the appraisal and/or credit report that are later added 
into the loan, and 
 refund of the escrow balance on the old loan.  This often occurs when a 
party other than the present holder originates the loan. 
 
VA does not set a “ceiling” or a specific dollar limitation on cash refunds 
resulting from adjustments at closing.  However, if a situation involves a 
borrower receiving more than $500, consult VA as to its acceptability.  
Lenders and VA personnel should exercise common sense when assessing 
such situations and draw from basic program information to know the 
difference between an equity withdrawal and cash from unforeseen 
circumstances. 
 
g. Maximum  Always use VA Form 26-8923, IRRRL Worksheet, to calculate the maximum 
Loan  loan amount.  The maximum loan amount is the existing VA loan balances 
plus the following: 
 
 including any late payments* and late charges, plus  
 allowable fees and charges (includes up to two discount points), plus  
 the cost of any energy efficiency improvements, and 
 the VA funding fee. 
 
*Any IRRRL that includes delinquent payments in the loan amount must be 
submitted for prior approval, even when a lender has automatic authority.

g. Maximum  Note:  There is no maximum dollar amount for VA loans.  Since an IRRRL 
Loan  rolls the above items into the new loan, and VA guarantees at least 25 percent 
(continued)  of the loan amount (without regard to the veteran’s entitlement), the new loan 
amount may be more than the limits established by the secondary market.  It 
is the lender’s responsibility to ensure it has a marketable loan. 
  
h. Amount of  No additional charge is made to the veteran’s entitlement for an IRRRL; such 
Guaranty and  as, the amount of the veteran’s previously used and available entitlement 
Entitlement Use  remains the same before and after obtaining the IRRRL. 
 
The new IRRRL loan amount may be equal to, greater than, or less than, the 
original amount of the loan being refinanced.  This may impact the amount of 
guaranty on the new loan, but not the veteran’s use of entitlement.  
 
Example Of New Loan Amount More Than Old Loan  
The existing VA loan was originally made for $110,000 with a guaranty of 
$27,500, or 25 percent.  The new IRRRL is for $112,000.  The guaranty on 
the new loan is $28,000 or 25 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use 
remains at $27,500. 
 
Example Of New Loan Amount Less Than Old Loan 
The existing VA loan was originally made for $42,000 with a guaranty of 
$25,000, or almost 60 percent (the percentage applicable under former law).  
The new IRRRL is for $40,000.  The guaranty on the new loan is $20,000 or 
50 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use remains at $25,000. 
 
Amount  How to calculate the amount of guaranty on an IRRRL 
IRRRLs  First, calculate the lesser of: 
up to   
$45,000   50 percent of the IRRRL loan amount, or 
 the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. 
 
The amount of guaranty is the greater of: 
 
 the above result, or 
 25 percent of the IRRRL loan amount.

k. Who Can an  Generally, the party(ies) obligated on the original loan must be the same on 
IRRRL be  the new loan (and the veteran must still own the property).   
Made to?   
The lender should contact VA regarding a proposed IRRRL involving a 
change in obligors unless the acceptability of the IRRRL is clear.  Sample 
cases are provided in the table in this subsection. 
 
Examples: 
 
In Case 7, the divorced spouse is keeping the home and wishes to refinance.  
The spouse cannot get an IRRRL unless the veteran agrees to be obligated on 
the new loan and commit his or her entitlement to the new loan.  A person 
without entitlement cannot get an IRRRL or any other type of VA loan. 
 
In Cases 8 through 10, the applicants cannot obtain an IRRRL because they 
do not include the veteran or a person who was the veteran’s spouse at the 
time the original loan was made, and who was obligated on the loan along 
with the veteran. 
 
In the case of the unmarried veteran obtaining the original loan (Case 8): 
 
 the marriage and death of the veteran occurred after the loan was made, and 
 the deceased veteran’s spouse is not obligated on the original loan.  Thus, 
an IRRRL is not possible. 
 
In the case of the veteran and spouse obligated on the original loan (Case 9): 
 
 the divorce, remarriage, then death of the veteran occurred after the loan 
was made and,  
the deceased veteran’s new spouse is not obligated on the original loan. 
Thus, an IRRRL is not possible.

1. Joint Loans 
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety  
 
a. What is a  “Joint loan” generally refers to a loan for which the: 
VA Joint   
Loan?   Veteran and other person(s) are liable, and 
 Veteran and the other obligor(s) own the security. 
 
 A joint loan is a loan made to the: 
 
 Veteran and one or more non-Veterans (not spouse),  
 Veteran and one or more Veterans (not spouse) who will not be using their 
entitlement, 
 Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, and both 
entitlement will be used; or 
 Veteran and one or more other Veterans (not spouse), all of who will use 
their entitlement. 
 
A loan involving a Veteran and his or her spouse will not be treated as a “joint 
loan” if the spouse is:  
 
 not a Veteran, or 
 a Veteran who will not be using his or her entitlement on the loan. 
 
A loan to a Veteran and fiancé who intend to marry prior to loan closing and 
take title as Veteran and spouse will be treated as a loan to a Veteran and 
spouse (conditioned upon their marriage), and not a joint loan.  
 
b. Regulations  The regulations in 38 C.F.R. 36.4307 address joint loans. 
 
c.  For purposes of applying the principles explained in this section, this term will 
Terminology  also be used to represent any other type of joint loan involving at least one 
Used in This  Veteran using his or her entitlement, and at least one other person not using 
Section    entitlement (can be a Veteran or a non-Veteran, but not a spouse). 
 
                                                                                           Continued on next page

c.  Examples  
Terminology   
Used in This    Three Veterans using entitlement and one non-Veteran 
Section,    One Veteran using entitlement and four non-Veterans 
continued    Two Veterans using entitlement and two Veterans not using                         
entitlement  
 
Two Veterans Joint Loan: Commonly meaning a loan involving two Veterans  
who are not married to each other and both are using their entitlement.  
 
For purposes of applying the principles explained in this section, this term will 
also be used to represent any other type of joint loan involving only Veterans, 
each of whom uses his or her entitlement.  
 
This may also include loans to the following:  
 
 The Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, if both 
entitlements will be used.  
 Entitlement and funding fees are separate. Funding fees are always 
calculated equally by the number of people on the loan.  It is based on 
each Veteran paying their equal share of the loan.  
 On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the funding fee is based on half of the 
base loan amount, downpayment, and sales price for the correct funding 
fee charge. 
 VA will only guarantee the Veteran’s portion of the total loan amount.  
  
 
d. Occupancy   The Veteran using entitlement on a joint loan must certify intent to personally 
occupy the property as his or her home.  
 
 
e. How Many  If a property is to be owned by two or more eligible Veterans, it may consist 
Units Can the  of four family units and one business unit, plus one additional unity for each 
Property  Veteran participating in the ownership.  
Have?   
Thus, two Veterans may purchase or construct residential property consisting 
of up to six family units (the basic four units plus one unit for each of the two 
Veterans), and one business unit. 
                                                                                       Continued on next page

g. How to  The following underwriting considerations apply: 
Underwrite a  Type of Joint Loan  Underwriting Considerations Function 
Joint Loan  Two Veteran Joint  Consider the credit and combined income and 
Loan  assets of both parties.  Strengths of one Veteran 
related to income and/or assets may compensate for 
income/asset weaknesses of the other.  However, 
satisfactory credit of one Veteran cannot 
compensate for the other’s poor credit. 
Veteran/Non-Veteran  Veteran’s credit must be satisfactory and Veteran’s 
Joint Loan  income must be sufficient to repay that portion of 
the loan allocable to the non-Veteran.  The credit of 
the non-Veteran must be satisfactory.  However, 
the combined income of both borrowers can be 
considered in evaluating repayment ability.   
 
In other words: 
  income strength of the Veteran may 
compensate for income weakness of the 
non-Veteran, but  
  income strength of the non-Veteran cannot 
compensate for income weakness of the 
Veteran in analyzing the Veteran’s ability to 
repay his or her allocable portion of the 
loan.  
 
_______________________________________________________________ 
   
h. How to  Guaranty is limited to that portion of the loan allocable to the Veteran’s   
Calculate  equal interest in the property. 
Guaranty and   
Entitlement  Percentage of entitlement has no bearing on the amount of the funding fee to 
Use on  be paid. (See Chapter 8). 
Veteran/Non-

Loans  secondary market can be met with this limited guaranty.

i. Procedure  Step  Action 
1  Divide the total loan amount by the number of borrowers. 
2  Multiply the result by the number of Veteran-borrowers who will be 
using entitlement on the loan. 
 
There is usually only one Veteran borrower, in which case the result 
of this Step is the same as the result of Step 1.  
3  Calculate the maximum potential guaranty on the portion of the loan 
arrived at in Step 2 (as if that portion was the total loan). 
4  VA will guarantee the lesser of: 
 
  the maximum potential guaranty amount arrived at in Step 3, 
or 
  the combined available entitlement of all Veteran-borrowers.  
5  VA makes a charge to the Veteran-borrower’s available entitlement 
in the amount of the guaranty. 
 
If more than one Veteran is involved, VA divides the entitlement 
charge equally between them, if possible.  If only unequal 
entitlement is available, unequal charges may be made with the 
written agreement of the Veterans.

• the combined available entitlement of all Veteran-borrowers. 
 
If the loan amount is greater than $144,000, additional entitlement 
may be added to each Veteran’s entitlement.  If possible, VA will 
use this additional entitlement to arrive at equal entitlement charges 
for the Veterans involved.

total the maximum guaranty arrived at in Step 1, or the total of their 
available entitlement if less than the maximum potential guaranty. 
 
VA will divide the entitlement charge equally between the Veterans 
if possible, or, if only unequal entitlement is available, unequal 
charges may be made with the Veterans’ written agreement. 
 
Exception: VA will make the entitlement charge for husband and 
wife Veterans according to their preference.

q. Equal  The applicability of the guaranty to only a portion of the loan in the case of a 
Credit  Veteran/non-Veteran joint loan may cause a lender to refuse to accept an 
Opportunity  application for such loan. 
Act   
Consideration This may appear to conflict with the ECOA prohibition against discrimination 
-s (ECOA)  based on marital status; however, the lender may refuse the application under 
these circumstances without violating ECOA. 
 
This is based on an exemption for VA being a special purpose credit program. 
 
r. Calculation  Apply the appropriate funding fee percentage to any portion of the loan   
of the Funding  allocable to a Veteran using his or her entitlement who is not exempt from the 
Fee  funding fee. Determine the appropriate percentage for the type of Veteran 
involved from the funding fee tables in Chapter 8. 
 
Example.  On a no-downpayment loan to two Veterans; on a first-time 
homebuyer; and on a subsequent user; the funding fee percentages of 2.15 
percent and 3.3 percent respectively would each be applied to one-half of the 
loan amount. 
 
No funding fee will be assessed on any portion of a joint loan allocable to a: 
 
 Non-Veteran 
 Veteran who did not use his or her entitlement, or 
 Veteran who used his or her entitlement, but is exempt from the funding 
fee. 
 
Downpayment.  The actual loan amount is allocated equally between the 
borrowers for purposes of calculating the funding fee, whether or not a 
downpayment is made, and regardless of where the funds for such a 
downpayment come from. 
 
 Example.  On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the non-Veteran makes a $5,000 
(five percent) downpayment out of his cash resources, to purchase a $100,000 
property, resulting in a $95,000 loan amount. The Veteran is a first-time 
homebuyer.  The Veteran must pay a funding fee of $712.50, based on 1.5 
percent of his/her $47,500 portion.

2. Construction/Permanent Home Loans 
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety  
 
a. The Basics  VA will guarantee a “construction/permanent home loan,” that is, a loan to 
finance the construction/purchase of a residence.  The loan is closed prior to 
the start of construction with proceeds disbursed to cover the cost of, or 
balance owed on, the land, and the balance into escrow.  The escrowed 
monies are paid out to the builder during construction. 
 
The lender must obtain written approval from the borrower before each draw 
payment is provided to the builder.  The loan will not be guaranteed until 
construction is complete and all Notice of Value (NOV) conditions are met. 
 
This section does not address other construction loans guaranteed by VA; that 
is, those for the purchase of a residence newly constructed for the Veteran by 
a builder who financed the construction from his or her own resources. 
 
Lenders should have the specialized experience to originate, process, 
underwrite (borrower, project, and builder), close, service and administer such 
loans.  These types of loans and projects inherently have uncertain elements 
that require careful examination.

b.  The Veteran begins making payments on a construction/permanent home loan 
Amortization  only after construction is complete.  Therefore, the initial payment on the 
principal may be postponed up to 1 year, if necessary.  The loan must be 
amortized to achieve full repayment within its remaining term.  The lender 
must provide evidence of the amortization in the loan file. 
 
Example.  If it takes 6 months to complete construction, the payment schedule 
for the Veteran obtaining a 30-year mortgage must provide for full repayment 
of the loan in 29 years and 6 months.

b.  Rather than requiring a balloon payment, it may be preferable to set up equal

continued  to repay the loan within the original maturity without a balloon payment. 
 
The VA requirement that loans be amortized with approximately equal 
payments and the principal must be reduced at least once annually, also 
applies to construction loans.  However, the final installment may be for an 
amount up to five percent of the original principal amount of the loan.

 hazard insurance during construction, and 
 property taxes. 
 
 
d. Interest  Lender’s may offer a “ceiling-floor” where the Veteran “floats” the interest 
Rate  rate during construction. The agreement must provide that at lock-in, the 
permanent interest rate will not exceed a specific maximum interest rate and 
permit the borrower to lock-in at a lower rate based on market fluctuations.  
The borrower must qualify for the mortgage at the maximum rate.

the construction completed, and 
 add any loan disbursements made for the purchase of the land on which the 
construction is situated.

3. Energy Efficient Mortgages  
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. What are  Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) are loans to cover the cost of making   
EEMs?  energy efficiency improvements to a dwelling.  They can be made in 
conjunction with a: 
 
  VA loan for the purchase of an existing dwelling, or 
  VA refinancing loan secured by the dwelling. 
 
Acceptable energy efficiency improvements include, but are not limited to: 
 
  solar heating systems, including solar systems for heating water for 
domestic use; 
  solar heating and cooling systems; 
  caulking and weather-stripping; 
  furnace efficiency modifications limited to replacement burners,  
boilers, or furnaces designed to reduce the firing rate or to achieve a 
reduction in the amount of fuel consumed as a result of increased 
combustion efficiency, devices for modifying flue openings which will 
increase the efficiency of the heating system, and electrical or mechanical 
furnace ignition systems which replace standing gas pilot lights; 
  clock thermostats; 
  new or additional ceiling, attic, wall and floor insulation; 
  water heater insulation; 
  storm windows and/or doors, including thermal windows and/or doors; 
  heat pumps; and 
  vapor barriers. 
 
b. Borrower  Information on EEMs is provided to a Veteran who applies for a loan which

continued  some localities, the utility company may perform this service.  The mortgage 
amount may be increased as a result of making energy efficiency 
improvements such as: Solar or conventional heating/cooling systems, water 
heaters, insulation, weather-stripping/caulking, and storm windows/doors.  
Other energy related improvements may also be considered.” 
 
The mortgage may be increased by: 
 
  Up to $3,000 based solely on the documented costs, 
  Up to $6,000 provided the increase in monthly mortgage payment 
does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, or 
  VA does not permit EEMs more than $6,000 (38 U.S.C. §3710(d)). 
 
 
 
c. Underwriting  Energy efficiency improvements up to $3,000: The resulting increase in loan 
Considerations  payments will normally be offset by a reduction in utility costs. 
 
Energy efficiency improvements more than $3,000, up to $6,000: The lender 
must make a determination that the increase in monthly mortgage payments 
does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, and must rely 
on locally available information provided by utility companies, 
municipalities, state agencies or other reliable sources, and document the 
determination. 
 
Energy efficiency improvements in conjunction with an Interest Rate 
Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL). If the monthly payment (Principal, 
Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI)) for the new loan exceeds the PITI of 
the loan being refinanced by 20 percent or more, the lender must certify to 
having determined that the Veteran qualified for the higher payment.

Calculate

Entitlement  1  Calculate guaranty on the loan without the portion attributable to    
Use?    the energy efficiency improvements. 
2  Calculate guaranty on the energy efficiency improvements  
portion by applying the same percentage used in Step 1. 
3  Add the results of Steps 1 and 2 to arrive at guaranty on the entire  
loan. 
 
However, the Veteran’s entitlement will only be charged the amount arrived 
at in Step 1; it is based upon the loan amount before adding the cost of the 
energy efficiency improvements. 
 
Example 1: If a Veteran has full entitlement and applies for a loan of 
$80,000, plus $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, VA will guarantee 
40 percent of the full loan amount of $86,000. Thus, the dollar amount of 
the guaranty will be $34,400, even though the charge to the Veteran’s 
entitlement is only $32,000. 
 
Example 2: If a Veteran with full entitlement applies for a $144,000 loan to 
purchase a home, and adds $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, the 
25 percent guaranty on the loan will only require the use of $36,000 
entitlement, but the dollar amount of guaranty will be $37,500.

Check the appropriate block in item 23, VA Form 26-1820, Report and            
Certification of Loan Disbursement. 
 
  No additional documentation concerning the escrowed/earmarked funds 
must be submitted when reporting the closed loan. 
 
Generally, the improvements should be completed within 6 months from the 
date of loan closing. 
 
Provide written notification to VA when improvements are completed          
and the escrow funds are disbursed.  Escrow requirements concerning 
completion of improvements are listed in Chapter 9 of this handbook.  
 
  Assure the funds are properly applied to the costs of improvements. 
 
If, after a reasonable time, the lender determines that the improvements will 
not be completed: 
 
  Apply the balance of the escrowed/earmarked funds to reduce the  
      principal balance on the loan, and 
  Provide written notification to VA that this has been done.

Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. What is a  A supplemental loan is a loan for the alteration, improvement, or repair of a 
Supplemental  residential property.  The residential property must secure an existing VA-
Loan?  guaranteed loan, and be owned and occupied by the Veteran, or the Veteran 
will reoccupy upon completion of major alterations, repairs, or 
improvements. 
 
The alterations, improvements, or repairs must: 
 
      Be for the purpose of substantially protecting or improving the basic  
     livability, or utility of the property, and 
      Be restricted primarily to the maintenance, replacement, improvement or  
     acquisition of real property, including fixtures. 
 
   Installation of features such as barbecue pits, swimming pools, etc., does     
   not meet this requirement. 
 
No more than 30 percent of the loan proceeds may be used for the 
maintenance, replacement, improvement, repair, or acquisition of non-
fixtures or quasi-fixtures such as refrigeration, cooking, washing, and 
heating equipment.  The equipment must be related to or supplement the 
principal alteration for which the loan is proposed.

 30 years if amortized, or 
 5 years if not amortized.  
 
c. Other  The existing loan must be current with respect to taxes, insurance, and 
Requirements  amortized payments, and must not otherwise be in default unless a primary 
purpose of the supplemental loan is to improve the ability of the borrower to 
maintain the loan obligation. 
 
The making of a supplemental loan can never result in any increase in the rate 
of interest on the existing loan. 
 
A supplemental loan to be written at a higher rate of interest than that payable 
on the existing loan must be evidenced by a separate note from the existing 
loan.

continued 
 If the supplemental loan will be consolidated with a related outstanding 
guaranteed loan, VA will issue a new modified guaranty certificate. 
 
 
g. Procedure  If the Veteran has no available entitlement, VA can still guarantee the 
supplemental loan provided the lender is the holder of the Veteran’s existing 
loan and the loans are to be consolidated. 
 
The amount of the modified guaranty will be the maximum guaranty 
effective on the existing loan at the time the supplemental loan is closed. 
 
To calculate the percentage of guaranty applicable to the combined 
indebtedness take the result of Step 1, and divide by the result of Step 3.  
 
Follow the steps in the table below to calculate the percentage of guaranty 
applicable to the combined indebtedness. 
   Step  Action 
1  Take the balance of the existing loan at the time of closing of the 
supplemental loan and multiply by the percentage of guaranty for the 
existing loan, as shown on the guaranty certificate. 
2  Calculate the amount of guaranty that would be issued on the 
supplemental loan as an independent loan (do not exceed the amount 
of entitlement available to the Veteran). 
3  Take the balance of the existing loan and add the amount of the 
supplemental loan. 
4  Take the result of Step 1 above and add the result of Step 2 above. 
5  Divide by the result of Step 3 above.

7. Loans Involving Temporary Interest Bydowns 
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. Description  As a marketing tool, builders, sellers, or lenders will sometimes establish and 
fund escrows to temporarily reduce a borrower’s loan payments during the 
initial years of the mortgage.  The borrower may also fund such an escrow for 
herself/himself as a financial management tool. 
 
VA will guaranty loans involving temporary interest rate buydowns, if 
otherwise eligible. 
 
A temporary interest rate buydown can be used in conjunction with any type 
of VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
b. Escrow  Funds must be safely escrowed with an independent third-party escrow agent 
Agreements  beyond the reach of prospective creditors of the builder, seller, lender, and the 
borrower. 
 
Exception.  If the Federal National Mortgage Association is the holder, it may 
take custody of the funds. 
 
The escrow agent must make payments directly to the lender or servicer.  The 
funds may be used only for payments due on the note.  The funds may not be 
used to pay past due monthly loan payments. If the loan is foreclosed or 
prepaid, the funds must be credited against the Veteran’s indebtedness. 
 
Escrowed funds may not revert to the party that established the escrow.  If    
the property is sold subject to, or on an assumption of the loan, the escrow   
must continue to pay out on behalf of the new owner.

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Policy  The VA Home Loan program involves a veteran’s benefit.  VA policy has 
evolved around the objective of helping the veteran to use his or her home 
loan benefit.  Therefore, VA regulations limit the fees that the veteran can pay 
to obtain a loan. 
 
Lenders must strictly adhere to the limitations on borrower-paid fees and 
charges when making VA loans. 
  
b.  The VA  In order to defray the cost of administering the VA Home Loan program, each 
Funding Fee  veteran must pay a funding fee to VA at loan closing.  
 
Congress may periodically change the funding fee rates to reflect changes in 
the cost of administering the program, or to assist a certain class of veterans.

do as it wishes with the funds from the flat charge, as long as the lender 
complies with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).   
 
Section 2, subsections c and d, of this chapter provide some examples of 
items that cannot be charged to the veteran as “itemized fees and charges.”  
 
This section provides more examples of items that cannot be paid by the 
veteran, but can be paid out of the lender’s flat charge or by some party other 
than the veteran. 
  
b.  Attorney’s  The lender may not charge the borrower for attorney’s fees.  However, 
Fees  reasonable fees for title examination work and title insurance can be paid by 
the borrower.  They are allowable itemized fees and charges.  
 
VA does not intend to prevent the veteran from seeking independent legal 
representation.  Therefore, the veteran can independently retain an attorney 
and pay a fee for legal services in connection with the purchase of a home.  
Closing documents should clearly indicate that the attorney’s fee is not being 
charged by the lender, but is being paid by the veteran as part of an 
independent arrangement with an attorney.

5. Seller Concessions 
  
Change Date  November 08, 2010, Change 15 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Definition  For the purposes of this topic, a seller concession is anything of value added 
to the transaction by the builder or seller for which the buyer pays nothing 
additional and which the seller is not customarily expected or required to pay 
or provide.   
  
b.  Seller  Seller concessions include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Concessions   
• payment of the buyer’s VA funding fee 
• prepayment of the buyer’s property taxes and insurance 
• gifts such as a television set or microwave oven 
• payment of extra points to provide permanent interest rate buydowns 
• provision of escrowed funds to provide temporary interest rate buydowns, 
and 
• payoff of credit balances or judgments on behalf of the buyer. 
 
Seller concessions do not include payment of the buyer’s closing costs, or 
payment of points as appropriate to the market. 
 
Example:  If the market dictates an interest rate of 7½ percent with two 
discount points, the seller’s payment of the two points would not be a seller 
concession.  If the seller paid five points, three of these points would be 
considered a seller concession. 
  
c.  The Problem  In some localities, builders or sellers offer concessions as a competitive tool.  
In extreme cases, the concessions may entice unwary and unqualified veterans 
into home mortgages they cannot afford.  The concessions may disguise the 
veteran’s inability to qualify for the loan.

a.  The  The lender must: 
Lender’s Role   
• verify the status of any veteran who may be exempt from paying the 
funding fee; 
• determine the amount of funding fee owed by any non-exempt borrower; 
• collect the appropriate fee from all non-exempt borrowers at loan closing; 
• electronically remit the funds to VA in a timely manner through the VA 
Funding Fee Payment System (FFPS); 
• print proof of payment of the funding fee; and

rating. 
• Veterans entitled to receive compensation, but who are not presently in 
receipt because they are on active duty.

compensation, a copy of the original VA notification of disability rating and 
documentation of the veteran’s service retirement income, or 
• indications on the Certificate of Eligibility (COE) that the borrower is 
entitled as an unmarried surviving spouse. 
 
Consult VA if the borrower’s status is unclear after reviewing the appropriate 
documents, or if conflicting information is found.

veteran’s income. 
 
Note:  A lender who believes that a servicemember may be exempt from 
payment of the funding fee based on a pre-discharge exam should contact the 
VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) of jurisdiction for assistance confirming the 
exempt status.

Indicate in the closing package that the veteran claims exempt status.  VA

If the veteran has a pending disability compensation claim at the time of loan 
closing, the funding fee must be remitted as if the borrower was not exempt. 
 
Advise the veteran to contact the VA RLC to request a refund if it is later 
determined that the veteran is entitled to compensation retroactively to a date 
prior to loan closing.

g.  How to Use  The lender must find the appropriate percentage in the tables using the 
the Funding  following parameters: 
Fee Tables   
• Is the veteran eligible for VA loan benefits through service in the regular 
military or the Reserves/National Guard?  Examine the COE.  For 
Reserves/National Guard, the COE bears the notation, 
“RESERVES/NATIONAL GUARD - INCREASED FUNDING FEE,” and 
is buff-colored rather than green. 
• Is the veteran a subsequent user of VA home loan benefits or obtaining his 
or her first VA loan?  Examine the COE.  An entitlement code of “5” 
indicates subsequent use, as does a loan number entered in the “Loan 
Number” column.  
• What type of loan is the veteran obtaining?  The funding fee varies 
depending upon whether the loan is a purchase or construction loan, an 
IRRRL, or a cash-out refinancing loan. 
• Is the veteran making a downpayment of at least five or ten percent? 
− Calculate what percentage of the sales price of the property the veteran is 
remitting as a downpayment. 
− The downpayment may come from the veteran’s own resources or 
borrowed funds.  Except, if the purchase price exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property, the difference between the purchase price and the 
reasonable value must be paid by the veteran in cash without borrowing. 
• For construction loans only, equity in the secured property counts as a 
downpayment for calculating the funding fee.

Lenders must ensure that the security instruments they use: 
 
  establish the required lien 
  comply with the laws and regulations governing VA’s home loan 
program 
  comply with applicable state laws, and 
  contain the following VA clauses:

c. Other  The mortgage or deed of trust must contain four additional clauses related to 
Clauses  the assumption of the loan.  VA does not specifically require that these 
clauses also be included in the note, unless this is required under state law to 
make them enforceable. Due to variations in local laws, the lender should 
obtain legal guidance as to any minor changes in these sample clauses which 
may be necessary to ensure that they have the effect required by the law and 
regulations; that is, the lender does not have to use the exact language 
provided for these four clauses. 
 
Acceleration Clause 
This loan may be declared immediately due and payable upon transfer of the 
property securing such loan to any transferee, unless the acceptability of the 
assumption of the loan is established pursuant to 38 U.SC. 3714. 
 
Funding Fee Clause 
A fee equal to one-half of one percent of the balance of this loan as of the date 
of transfer of the property shall be payable at the time of transfer to the loan 
holder or its authorized agent, as trustee for the VA. If the assumer fails to pay 
this fee at the time of transfer, the fee shall constitute an additional debt to that 
already secured by this instrument, shall bear interest at the rate herein 
provided, and at the option of the payee of the indebtedness hereby secured or 
any transferee thereof, shall be immediately due and payable.  This fee is 
automatically waived if the assumer is exempt under the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 3729(c). 
 
Processing Charge Clause  
Upon application for approval to allow assumption of this loan, a processing 
fee may be charged by the loan holder or its authorized agent for determining 
the creditworthiness of the assumer and subsequently revising the holder’s 
ownership records when an approved transfer is completed. The amount of 
this charge shall not exceed the maximum established by VA for a loan to 
which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies. 
 
Indemnity Liability Assumption Clause 
If this obligation is assumed, then the assumer hereby agrees to assume all of 
the obligations of the Veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and 
securing the loan. The assumer further agrees to indemnify VA to the extent 
of any claim payment arising from the guaranty or insurance of the 
indebtedness created by this instrument.

2. Escape Clause and Notice of Value (NOV)  
 
Change Date  July 30, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Sales  The Escape Clause must be contained in the sales contract for all VA-
Contract  guaranteed loans.   The lender is responsible for ensuring that the paragraph is 
in the sales contract prior to closing.  In the event the clause is not in the sales 
contract, VA may not guaranty the loan. 
 
b. Builders and  The builders/realtors that initiate contracts on new construction must ensure 
Realtors  that the Escape Clause is in the contract and the contract is signed by the 
Veteran and seller. 
 
c. Upgrades  Upgrades are not considered earnest money and the builder is not required to 
refund this money.  When the NOV is below the sales contract price, this 
clause protects the Veteran with negotiation of the sales contract. 
 
d. Escape  If the sales contract was signed by the Veteran prior to receipt of the NOV, 
Clause  the contract must include, or be amended to include, the clause below. 
 
“It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
contract, the purchaser shall not incur any penalty by forfeiture of earnest 
money or otherwise or be obligated to complete the purchase of the property 
described herein, if the contract purchase price or cost exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property established by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The 
purchaser shall, however, have the privilege and option of proceeding with the 
consummation of this contract without regard to the amount of the reasonable 
value established by the Department of Veterans Affairs (38 U.S.C. 501, 
3703(c)(1)).”   
 
This clause may be found at 38 C.F.R. 36.4303(k)(4) in its entirety.

Change Date  July 30, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Estate of the  VA regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4354 provide the parameters for the required 
Veteran in the  estate of a Veteran in real property securing a VA-guaranteed loan. 
Property   
The lender is responsible for ensuring the loan conforms to these parameters.  
For IRRRLs (see Chapter 6, Topic 6, Item k of this handbook). 
 
A beneficial interest in a revocable Family Living Trust that ensures that the 
Veteran, or Veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the 
lien attaches to any remainder interest and the trust arrangement is valid under 
state law. 
   
b. Estate Title   Generally, title to the estate shall be that which is acceptable to informed 
buyers, title companies, and attorneys in the community in which the 
property is situated. 
   
c. Mortgage  VA does not allow an individual to take title to a property if that individual is  
Note or Deed  not on either the mortgage note or a mortgage deed of trust.  Accordingly, if  
a spouse or other owner does not want to sign a mortgage note and be  
obligated for a VA-guaranteed home loan that individual must sign a  
mortgage deed of trust. 
   
d.  Title  VA does not require a lender making a VA loan or the Veteran-borrower to  
Insurance  obtain title insurance.  The lender may apply its own title insurance 
requirements to VA loan transactions.  VA requires only that title to the  
property meet the standards described above in “Estate of the Veteran in the 
Property.”

a state, territorial, or local government program where restrictions in 
the legal instruments require acceleration of the loan if it is assumed 
by a party ineligible for assistance under the program. 
  Such acceleration must be mandated by federal, state, territorial, or 
local law or regulation. 
 
VA may guarantee a loan made through a state or local government program, 
designed to assist low-or moderate-income individuals, which imposes 
resale and price restrictions on purchasers.  Under such a program, if the 
property is resold within a period established by local law or ordinance, 
certain restrictions as set forth in 38 C.F.R. 36.4354(b)(5)(iv)(A) on to whom 
the property may be sold, the resale price, and other restrictions approved by 
the Secretary may be applied. 
 
VA may guarantee a loan on which a title restriction limits the sale, lease, or 
occupancy of the dwelling to persons based on age, including a prohibition 
against the permanent occupancy of the dwelling by children, provided such 
restriction complies with applicable federal law (38 U.S.C. 3704(c)).   
 
VA may refuse to approve a property with an age restriction if its operation 
would create an undue hardship upon the owner in the case of sudden, 
unforeseen events or be likely to result in an increased risk of loan default.

Without such a determination by VA, the lender risks a later finding that the 
condition or limitation affects the reasonable value of the property to the 
extent that: 
 
  the loan will be ineligible for guaranty, or 
  a claim on the guaranty will be subject to reduction under 38 C.F.R. 
36.4325.

Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Policy  Loans for the purchase and construction of homes will be first liens, subject 
only to taxes, special assessments, and ground rents.  VA will not approve

  are legally or practically necessary, and 
  result in no prejudice to the Veterans or the Government. 
   
b.  The lender must obtain VA prior approval of liens held by private parties 
Requirements  which are superior to VA home mortgage liens.  Liens held by mandatory 
membership home associations in planned unit developments are not 
addressed in this topic.  The lender must demonstrate that:

mortgage, 
  there is a viable rationale for not subordinating the superior lien, 
  the superior lien will not prejudice Veterans or the Government, and 
  if periodic charges or assessments are involved, the amounts are 
reasonable and limits on the amounts have been established. 
 
   
c. VA Approval  Always obtain VA approval before the lien is recorded. Builders and

36.4356): 
 
  Liens for taxes, assessments, and ground rents. 
  Liens by private entities to secure assessments or charges for

8.  Power of Attorney (POA) 
    
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Policy  VA will allow a Veteran to use an attorney-in-fact to execute any documents 
necessary to obtain a VA-guaranteed loan.  This enables active duty 
servicepersons stationed overseas, and other Veterans who cannot be present 
to execute loan documents, to obtain VA loans. 
 
b.  The Veteran must execute a general or specific POA which is valid and 
Requirements  legally adequate.  The Veteran’s attorney-in-fact (as specified in the POA) 
must use this POA to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and initiate 
processing of a loan on behalf of the Veteran.  A military POA is considered a 
general POA and is only valid during the Active Duty Servicemembers’ 
(ADSM) period of deployment, not to exceed 1 year. 
 
To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, ensure that the 
general or specific POA complies with state law to the extent that: 
 
  the mortgage can be legally enforced in that jurisdiction, and 
  clear title can be conveyed in the event of foreclosure. 
 
To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, VA also requires 
the Veteran’s written consent to the specifics of the transaction either through 
a general POA or a specific POA. 
 
General POA - The Veteran’s signature on both the sales contract and the 
Uniform Residential Loan Application, as long as the Veteran’s intention to 
obtain a VA loan on the particular property is expressed somewhere in those 
documents.

act for said officer), affirmatively indicating that the Veteran was alive 
and, if the Veteran is on active military duty, not missing in action status 
on (date), was examined by the undersigned and that the said date is on or 
subsequent (not prior) to the date the note and security instruments were 
executed on the Veteran’s behalf by the attorney-in-fact.” 
 
VA may deny guaranty on a loan if the lender failed to properly verify the 
Veteran’s status and the Veteran was deceased (or MIA) at the time the loan 
was closed. 
                       
d.  Digital  Digital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature

Construction 
     
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Procedures  Prior to requesting an appraisal of proposed construction, the lender must 
review the sales contract or purchase agreement on the property.  The lender 
must determine whether the contract: 
 
  is acceptable, and 
  does not contain unfair contractual provisions. 
    
b. Revisions  The lender must request revisions of an unacceptable contract by the parties 
to the transaction.  The lender should report unacceptable contract practices 
by a VA program participant (such as a builder) to VA if: 
 
  the program participant is engaged in practices which seriously 
prejudice the interests of Veterans or the Government, or 
  the program participant repeatedly uses unacceptable contracts or 
contracts containing unfair contractual provisions, and is 
uncooperative in changing such practices 
   
c. Closing  The closing of the loan indicates that the lender has determined the contract is 
acceptable. 
   
d. Examples of  Example  Unfair Contract Provisions or Features 
Unfair 
1  Provisions allowing the downpayment or earnest money of the 
Contract 
purchaser to be forfeited or retained as liquidated damages if 
Provisions or 
the purchaser cannot obtain VA financing. 
Features 
2  Inclusion in a lump-sum contract of an “escalator clause” which 
obligates the purchaser to pay a higher price in the event of 
increased costs for labor, material, or other items prior to delivery 
of title unless accompanied by a proviso which gives the 
purchaser the option of canceling the contract and obtaining a 
refund of the moneys paid, if the increased price is not acceptable 
to the buyer/Veteran.

4  A requirement that purchasers waive or release any claim or right 
for nonperformance by the builder under the contract. 
 
This does not prevent a builder from obtaining a statement from 
the purchaser at closing that he or she has inspected the house and 
has not observed any unsatisfactory construction, nor does it 
prevent the builder from obtaining a release from the purchaser in 
settlement of a bona fide dispute. 
5  Omission of an accurate property description. 
6  Omission of a provision specifying whether the builder or the 
Veteran is to be charged with any special assessments or 
improvement bonds. This includes those assessments or bonds 
which are payable in the future, for improvements included in the

11.  Hazard Insurance 
  
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. General  The lender is responsible for ensuring that hazard insurance is obtained prior 
Requirements  to loan closing, and maintained for the term of the loan.  It must be of an 
insurance type or types and in an amount sufficient to protect the property 
against risks or hazards to which it may be subjected in the locality.  
Generally, the type(s) and amount of insurance coverage customary in the 
locality will satisfy this requirement.  Policies must provide that all amounts 
payable, including unearned premiums, shall be payable to the holder, or to a 
trustee or other person for the holder.  All policy payments received for 
insured losses must be applied to the restoration of the security or to the loan 
balance. 
 
b. Flood  The lender is responsible for ensuring that flood insurance is obtained and 
Insurance  maintained on any building or personal property that secures a VA loan if the 
Requirements  property is located in a special flood hazard area (SFHA), as identified by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The following flood 
insurance considerations may apply: 
 
  The lender/holder’s responsibility extends through the entire term of 
the loan, and includes insuring any secured property that becomes 
newly located in a SFHA due to FEMA remapping. 
 
  The VA appraiser’s opinion on whether the property is located in a 
SFHA does not relieve the lender from responsibility for ensuring 
flood insurance coverage on a property which is in fact located in a 
SFHA. 
 
  Personal property requiring coverage can include a manufactured 
home and its appliances, carpet, etc. if they secure the loan.

continued 
National Flood Insurance Act. 
 
  Contact local property insurance agents or brokers, or FEMA regional 
offices, for current information on maximum available coverage. 
 
Note: VA cannot guarantee a loan if the security is located in a SFHA and 
flood insurance is not available. 
   
c.  VA may reduce a future guaranty claim based on the lender’s noncompliance 
Consequences  with VA hazard/flood insurance requirements which results in uninsured 
of Uninsured  losses (unless a waiver has been granted).  The lender must determine the 
Losses 
minimum insurance coverage needed to meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. 
36.4329 for a specific loan.  If the required amount of coverage is maintained, 
no future guaranty claim can be reduced due to inadequate coverage provided 
there has been no change in the nature, value, or use of the security that 
would require new or additional coverage (based on what is customary in the 
locality) since VA’s determination was made.

d. Special  Condominiums and many townhouse homeowners associations (HOAs) 
Considerations  maintain blanket or master policies on common areas, including common 
with  mechanical and structural elements.  The limits of coverage should be 
Homeowners  described in the policy, and may also be referred to in the organizational 
Associations 
documents.  Lenders should be aware that policies maintained by some HOAs 
may not provide adequate coverage.   
 
Condominium HOAs may protect only the shell of the structure. These “studs

  interior walls, 
  flooring, 
  plumbing or electrical fixtures, 
  cabinets, 
  heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment,

that adequate coverage is in effect (and check periodically for any changes in 
coverage).  If coverage is inadequate, the homeowner can be held responsible 
through the terms of the loan instruments, for maintaining coverage on the 
portions of the real property not covered by the master policy.

a. General  VA permits Veteran purchasers to utilize HAP services when obtaining a VA 
Information  home loan. Both government and private entities administer HAPs.

blanket approval for use with VA loans.  These state and local 
programs are not to be confused with the Department of Defense 
HAP. 
  HAPs that do not fall under the blanket approval, should forward the 
documentation to the VA RLC with jurisdiction over property state.  
     
b.  Lenders making VA loans involving HAPs must ensure the following: 
Requirements   
  the borrower(s) meet(s) VA credit standards,  
  the lender obtains a VA appraisal, and  
  the property must meet VA minimum property standards. 
 
If the sale price of the property exceeds the VA reasonable value of the 
property, VA will only allow HAP assistance in the form of a grant to pay 
the difference.  Otherwise the Veteran must pay the difference of price 
over value from his or her own funds without borrowing. 
 
HAPs often require buyers to occupy the property for a specified period of 
time.  The lender must, at closing, obtain the borrower’s 
acknowledgement of this requirement, and provide a copy of the signed 
acknowledgement if VA requests the loan file for review.

c. HAP Fees  Chapter 8 of this handbook lists closing charges that Veteran-borrowers are not 
allowed to pay when a one-percent loan origination fee is charged.  Since HAPs 
are designed to assist low to moderate income buyers, lenders may not charge 
Veteran-borrowers unallowable fees and use HAP funds to offset these charges 
since this practice dilutes the assistance that the HAP was intended to provide.

for an  however, a “legal non-conforming” use is acceptable and should be 
Appraisal   described in the appraisal (see Chapter 12, Topic 12 of this 
Handbook). 
 
  A property that is primarily non-residential is ineligible for VA loan 
guaranty (see Chapter 12, Topic 11 of this Handbook). 
 
  For new and proposed construction cases, if the local building 
authority routinely performs construction inspections, but none were 
conducted, the property is ineligible for VA loan guaranty (see Topic 
14 of this chapter). 
 
  Condo-hotel properties (Condotels) where units are placed in a rental 
pool and “air” condominiums that do not have a homeowners 
association are not eligible for an appraisal. (see Chapter 11, Topic 12 
of this Handbook.) 
 
  A property is ineligible for an appraisal if any party of interest to the 
transaction, other than the purchaser, is debarred Government-wide, or 
excluded from participation in the Loan Guaranty program due to a 
VA-imposed sanction. Sanctions typically involve construction 
complaints or unfair marketing practices.  Lenders must confirm that 
builders of properties appraised as new or proposed construction have 
a valid VA-issued builder ID number to ensure that sanctioned 
builders do not participate in the VA Home Loan Guaranty program 
(see Topic 11 of this chapter). If the sanctioned party is a builder, this 
restriction applies to any property still owned by the builder, including 
houses under construction and existing houses.  VA’s refusal to 
appraise will not be affected by either the fact that the local building 
authority approved the work on which the sanction was based, or the 
builder changes the company’s name or organizational structure or 
becomes a principal or officer in another organization.

Appendix 1. Steps for Requesting an Appraisal 
   
  Step  Action 
1  Obtain a user ID and password for the Veterans Information Portal (VIP) (see 
Chapter 10, Topic 2 of this Handbook) 
2  Ensure that the property is eligible for an appraisal.  Contact the RLC with any 
questions about property eligibility or if the property is not eligible, but is 
already the security for a VA loan 
3  Request for Certificate of Eligibility (COE) 
 
4  Log on to VIP and select WebLGY > Request Appraisal > Select Appraisal 
Type 
5  Input all requested information to generate VA Form 26-1805-1, VA Request 
for Determination of Reasonable Value 
6  To avoid a delay for the Veteran, provide a complete legal description and 
ensure that the Point of Contact’s (POC) information is correct and that the 
POC can provide access to the property for the appraiser without any 
additional calls 
7  WebLGY will: 
- assign a case number (in liquidation cases, this will be the existing VA loan 
number for the property that must be provided by the requester) 
- assign an appraiser (since VA is required by law to select the fee appraiser on 
a rotational basis from a panel maintained by VA) 
-generate a completed VA Form 26-1805-1, VA Request for Determination of 
Reasonable Value 
-e-mail the assignment to the VA-assigned fee appraiser

  Step  Action 
8  If the Veteran is purchasing a home, the same day the assignment is made, the 
requester must upload a copy of the sales contract and any construction 
exhibits into WebLGY. VA highly recommends the use of reduced-size 
construction drawings to save copying, mailing, and storage costs for all 
parties involved. Building plans, elevations and details, traditionally drawn at 
¼ inch scale and larger, can be photographically reduced or computer-drawn 
to be clearly readable on 8½ by 14-inch pages. Other exhibits normally 
provided in an 8½ by 11-inch format (such as specifications, certifications, 
etc.) must not be further reduced.  VA does not accept 11 by 17-inch pages as 
this size is not compatible with scanning equipment generally available to 
program participants. 
9  For all appraisal types, if the legal description is lengthy and does not fit in the 
legal description block on the appraisal request, a copy of the complete legal 
description must be uploaded into WebLGY the same day the assignment is 
made. 
10  In most cases, the appraisal will be assigned instantly.  If an appraiser is not 
assigned by WebLGY, please notify the RLC of jurisdiction. Requesters must 
not re-enter the information as a duplicate appraisal request will be generated.

2. Market Value 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Market  The appraiser must estimate the market value, as "the most probable price that 
Value  a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions 
Definition  requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, 
knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.”  
VA considers reasonable value and market value to be synonymous.  VA’s 
definition of market value is consistent with that used by Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and major appraisal organizations.  
 
b. Protecting  The quality of the appraisal is critical in protecting the interests of Veterans, 
the Interests of  lenders, servicers, and VA.  This fact requires VA to be integrally involved in 
Veterans,  its management and oversight of the appraisal process, from the initial 
Lenders, 
assignment of the appraiser through the issuance of the Notice of Value 
Servicers and 
(NOV), as well as oversight performed on closed loans.

c. Oversight  Any appraisal report is unacceptable if the analysis is not based upon 
recognized appraisal practices and was intended to "accommodate" or "meet" 
the sales price.

Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Definition  The UAD improves the quality and consistency of appraisal data by defining 
all fields required on specific appraisal forms and standardizes definitions and 
responses for a key subset of fields. Regardless of the geographic location of 
the property or any localized reporting conventions, the UAD standardization 
includes: 
 
  Formats for fields that include dates, values, and other data,  
  Allowable values from a list of choices provided for certain fields, 
  Abbreviations to allow more information to fit on printed appraisal 
forms, and  
  Ratings and definitions for the “Condition” and “Quality” of the 
property and “Updated/Remodeled” status. 
 
b. UAD- Appraisals prepared on Fannie Mae Forms 1004, 1073, 1075 or 2055 must be 
Compliant  UAD-compliant and must include the definitions for the property condition 
Forms  and quality ratings and the property description abbreviations used.

Information  remodeling in the past 15 years.  VA expects fee appraisers to recognize and 
describe remodeling or updating and to make appropriate adjustments. Fee 
appraisers should also report UAD information concerning the remodeling if 
it is available in the “normal course of business” within VA timeliness 
requirements for completion of the appraisal. 
 
e. UAD  Since origination appraisals are prepared “subject to” any repairs needed for

Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Comparable  The appraiser must include, at a minimum, three closed sales which the 
Sale Selection  appraiser believes are the best available sales and provide comments to 
support the selection, when appropriate.  Comparable sales should be selected 
based on similar locational and physical characteristics, not sales price.  
Recent sales in the same established subdivision, condominium or PUD are 
typically the best indicators of value.  The sales should be similar to the 
subject property to the extent that the sales would be competing properties if 
they were on the market at the same time as the subject property. 
 
b. Comments  The appraiser should provide comments when adjustments are made for 
Explaining  points of comparison that are not self-explanatory or when large adjustments 
Adjustments  are made.  Providing detailed commentary about the market and comparable 
selection may reduce the number of requests for revisions of appraisals. 
 
c. Limited Sales  If the sales data from the market area is limited, the appraiser must provide the 
Data  best information available and comments with the appraiser’s professional 
opinion about the market, any reasons for the lack of sales data, and the 
various differences between the subject and the comparable sales. 
 
d. Distance of  VA does not set minimum or maximum distance requirements between the 
Comparable  subject and comparable sale properties.  In suburban or rural communities, the 
Sales  market areas may be greatly expanded and suitable comparable sales may be 
many miles away from the subject. In such cases, the appraiser should specify 
why those comparable sales were used and how they compare with the 
subject.  
 
e. Sales of REO  The appraiser may use sales of Real Estate Owned (REO) properties or short 
Properties  sales if transactions of this nature are prevalent in the market.  A transaction 
involving a foreclosure transfer to a mortgage servicer is not evidence of 
market value and must not be considered as a comparable sale.

f. Sales From  If the property is in a new subdivision or condominium, the appraiser should 
Competing  include, if available for comparison, properties constructed by a competing 
Developments  builder in the subject market area as well as properties within the subject 
subdivision or condominium. 
 
g. Market- All adjustments on the market data grid should be market-derived, based on 
derived  the amount the appraiser estimates a typical buyer would pay for the item in 
Adjustments  the market.  Adjustments reflect contributory value in the market, which does 
not necessarily equal the cost of an item. 
 
h. Sales  Sales concessions typically include financing incentives or non-realty items.  
Concessions  As all adjustments must be market-derived, the adjustment should reflect the 
difference between the sales price with the sales concessions, and what the 
property would have sold for without the concessions under typical market 
conditions.  The sales concessions on the comparable properties are adjusted 
to typical market expectations, not to the specific terms or conditions of the 
sale of the subject. Any concession adjustments must be downward 
adjustments as positive adjustments for sales concessions are not acceptable. 
 
i. Recent Sales  Comparable sales should reflect the most recent activity in the market.  
Comparable sales are preferably sales that have taken place within the last 6 
months, and generally sales that are not more than 12-months old, unless 
explained by the appraiser.

j. Time  Market condition (time) adjustments are made to reflect value changes in the 
Adjustments  market between the date of the contract for the comparable sale and the 
effective date of the appraisal.  The appraiser must provide comments about 
current market trends to support any time adjustments.  
 
In an increasing market, positive market condition adjustments should be 
made if there is evidence, based on a thorough analysis of specific market 
trends, of increasing prices, a shortage of homes for sale, or decreasing 
marketing times. 
 
In a declining market, negative market condition adjustments should be made 
if there is evidence of a decline in prices, an oversupply, or extended 
marketing times.  
 
k. Condition  Since VA appraisals must be prepared “subject to” the completion of any 
Adjustments  repairs needed in order for the property to meet VA’s MPRs (see Chapter 12 
of this handbook), the condition for the subject property compared with the 
comparable sales on the market data grid should reflect the condition with the 
repair items completed.

Change Date  July 22, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. SAR’s  When issuing an NOV in WebLGY, the SAR must electronically certify the 
Certification of  following: “I reviewed this appraisal report to determine the acceptability of 
Appraisal  the property for VA Loan Guaranty purposes in light of VA minimum property 
Review 
requirements and the appropriateness, completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the fee appraiser’s reasonable value determination. In completing 
this administrative review, I am performing a due diligence function and not 
acting as, or taking the responsibility of, a cosigner of the report or 
supervisory appraiser.  Any disagreements or comments, etc., resulting from 
the administrative review of this appraisal are fully explained on the 
attachment to this report.”  (WebLGY notes are considered “the attachment to 
this report” referenced in this certification).

Responsibilities  when initially approved by VA, the SAR is certifying that he/she: 
 
  personally reviewed the appraisal report (see Topic 3 of this Chapter), 
  concurred with the fee appraiser’s recommendation, except as 
noted in WebLGY notes, 
  did not exert pressure or undue influence on the appraiser to change 
information or to reach a predetermined value for the subject property 
in order to accommodate the sale price or mortgage transaction, and 
  determined that the appraiser used methodologies that were 
appropriate and reasonable in light of industry-accepted appraisal 
techniques, made conclusions that were consistent, based upon the 
data in the report, and complied with applicable VA requirements.

only those repairs that are needed for the property to meet MPRs.  SARs must 
place notes in WebLGY justifying any non-MPR repairs or inspections 
recommended by appraisers that the SAR has determined are not required on 
the NOV.

4. Appraisal Management System  
 
Change Date  July 22, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Electronic  When the appraiser uploads the completed appraisal report into WebLGY, 
Scoring of the  VA’s Appraisal Management System (AMS) will electronically read and 
Appraisal  score the appraisal, assisting SARs in quickly assessing appraisal risk, 
determining property eligibility, ensuring VA policy compliance and 
identifying over/under-valuations, and appraisal quality issues. SARs must 
use AMS as a tool to help ensure appraisals are accurate, complete, and that 
the property is properly valued according to VA-accepted appraisal principles 
and practices. 
 
b. Business  As a rules-based system, AMS will assist SARs in finding inconsistencies by 
Rules in AMS  flagging items as potentially problematic, and determining whether the 
appraisal is in compliance with VA appraisal requirements, industry-accepted 
appraisal principles, and Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice (USPAP). 
 
c. Alerts  Alerts will be noted by the AMS based on VA’s business rules.  All high 
Provided by  alerts must be addressed in WebLGY notes.  Medium and low alerts do not 
AMS  require a comment, but should be carefully reviewed by the SAR.  Often the 
alerts will reflect an NOV condition that must be required, with no 
clarification needed from the appraiser. 
 
d. VA Guidance  VA will issue a circular periodically describing the AMS scores that will be 
on Specific  considered low-risk and high-risk appraisals.  SARs may perform a cursory 
AMS Scores  review on low-risk appraisals.  High-risk appraisals require a comprehensive 
review. Sometimes a score of “N/A” will be reported for complex, rural, or 
new/proposed construction properties due to a lack of market data.  While this 
is not an indication of a high-risk appraisal, a comprehensive review must be 
performed since the AMS did not return a score within the acceptable range 
for a cursory review.   SARs must indicate whether or not a cursory review 
was performed in WebLGY with the indicator on the screen where the NOV 
is issued.

not available.  If WebLGY is not available, the SAR may issue the NOV 
outside of WebLGY, entering the NOV in WebLGY when the system is back 
online.  A note should be entered documenting that this procedure was 
followed.

NOV  NOV Condition  Details for including this condition on an NOV 
Conditions, 
1. Energy Conservation  Item 1a should be marked on NOVs for existing 
continued 
properties (over 1-year old or previously occupied) to 
allow lenders to increase the loan amount for Veterans 
wishing to make energy efficiency improvements (see 
Chapter 7 of this Handbook).  Item 1b should be 
marked on NOVs for new or proposed construction 
excluding manufactured homes. For new and proposed 
manufactured homes, energy efficiency is already 
covered by the manufacturer’s guidelines (see Chapter 
12, Topic 42 of this Handbook) so this item should not 
be marked.   
2.  Wood Destroying  If the property is located in an area on the Termite 
Insect Information  Infestation Probability Map where the probability of 
termite infestation is "very heavy" or "moderate to 
heavy," a wood destroying insect inspection report 
must be required on the Notice of Value (NOV).  Mark 
2a if the property is existing or new construction, or 
item 2b if the property is proposed. For new 
construction, if a soil treatment guarantee is provided, 
this is preferable and will satisfy condition 2a.  The 
pest control operator must meet all state requirements. 
State-required inspection forms are acceptable.  
Inspection reports are valid for 90 days.  Soil treatment 
guarantees differ from an inspection and are 
consequently valid well beyond 90 days.  A wood-
destroying insect inspection is not required on units in 
low-rise or high-rise condominiums (units are stacked 
vertically) unless the appraiser notes a potential 
infestation problem.  For site condominiums, and villa 
or townhome style condominiums where units are not 
vertically stacked, an inspection must be required on 
the NOV unless evidence of a treatment guarantee has 
been provided by the homeowners association.

homeowners association fees must be shown on the 
NOV.  Special assessments including local authorities 
collecting Community Development District (CDD) 
fees or other fees on the HOA’s behalf should be 
reported here as well.  
4. Condominium  If the condominium is conditionally accepted by VA, 
this item should be marked.  This item is not required 
if the condominium is fully accepted by VA.  If the 
condominium has not been accepted by VA, the NOV 
must not be issued.  (See Chapter 11, Topic 12 of this 
Handbook). 
5. Private Road/Shared  If access to the property is by a private road or shared 
Driveway  driveway, this item should be marked, unless the 
property is in a PUD or condominium with private 
streets which are covered by the organizational 
documents.  If a state law establishes requirements for 
the maintenance of private roads, this condition is not 
needed on the NOV.  
6. Flood Insurance  If the property is located in a Special Flood Hazard 
Area, this item must be marked. It is the lender's 
responsibility to ensure that flood insurance is 
obtained and maintained on properties located in 
SFHAs, whether or not the appraiser correctly 
identifies the property as being in an SFHA.  If flood 
insurance is not available, a property in a SFHA is not 
eligible to be the security for a VA-guaranteed loan. 
7. Water/Sewage  If the property has an individual water supply, such as 
System Acceptability  a well, this condition must be marked.  For proposed 
construction cases, acceptance of an individual sewage 
system must be required.  Acceptance of the sewage 
system is also required for existing or new 
construction cases in which there is an indication of a 
problem or the property is in an area known to have 
soil percolation problems. Certifications are valid for 
90 days unless the local authority indicates otherwise.

Dear [Mr. or Ms.]  [Veteran’s last name]: 
 
The above property has been appraised by a fee appraiser assigned by the VA Regional Loan Center in [ 
RLC City and State]. On [date NOV issued], the VA-authorized appraisal reviewer personally reviewed the fee 
appraiser's report and determined the property's estimated reasonable value to be $[ value ]. The maximum 
repayment period for a loan secured by this property is [30 years or estimated remaining economic life on 
appraisal, whichever is less].   
   
The VA appraisal was made to determine the reasonable value of the property for loan purposes. 
The appraisal must not be considered a building inspection. Neither VA nor the lender can guarantee that 
the home will be satisfactory to you in all respects or that all equipment will operate properly. A thorough 
inspection of the property by you or a reputable inspection firm may help minimize any problems that 
could arise after loan closing. In an existing home, particular attention should be given to plumbing, 
heating, electrical and roofing components. VA recommends testing for radon, which the government has 
determined can cause lung cancer.   
   
REMEMBER: VA GUARANTEES THE LOAN, NOT THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY

 This section has been updated to add subsection lettering and to make 
minor grammatical edits. 
  
a. Purpose of  The purpose of the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) is to 
LAPP  speed up the time to loan closing by allowing VA-authorized lenders to 
receive appraisal reports directly from appraisers and process them 
without VA involvement. 
  
b. How LAPP  There are basically four steps in processing LAPP cases. 
Works 
 
Stage  Description 
1  The LAPP lender requests VA assignment of a fee appraiser 
and a VA loan number (same as any other case) and identifies 
the case as “LAPP.” 
2  The VA-assigned appraiser sends the appraisal report directly 
to the LAPP lender’s VA-approved staff appraisal reviewer 
(SAR). 
3  The LAPP lender’s SAR 
 
 reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques as 
well as other VA requirements, 
 determines the reasonable value of the property and any 
conditions which must be met prior to VA guaranty of the 
loan, and 
 sends the veteran buyer a written notice of the value which 
includes any conditions or requirements upon which the VA 
loan guaranty is contingent. 
4  The LAPP lender then underwrites and closes the loan on the 
automatic basis and requests VA guaranty.

Common Interest Communities 
  
Introduction  While only condominiums must be approved by VA, lots or units securing VA loans  
in condominiums and other planned unit developments must meet both title and lien-related VA 
regulatory requirements.  The lender is responsible for ensuring that these requirements are met for 
each VA loan.  Although there is no specific VA requirement that lenders maintain evidence in the 
loan file that these requirements are met, they may wish to be guided by the advice of their legal 
counsel in this regard. 
 
Acceptable  The title requirements for every VA loan, whether or not the property is located in a common 
Title  interest communities, are stated in VA regulations 
(38 CFR 36.4350).  These requirements indicate 
 
 the estate must not be less than fee simple, except under certain circumstances (38 CFR 
36.4350(a)) 
 title must to be subject to unreasonable restrictions o use and occupancy, except under 
certain circumstances (38 CFR 36.4350(b)), and 
 certain minor title limitations will not be considered by VA, to the extent described, as 
materially affecting the value of the property 
 (38 CFR 36.4350 (c)).

Superior VA  VA regulations require that every VA loan be secured by a first lien on the property, except 
Lien  under certain circumstances.  (38 CFR 36.4351 and 38 CFR 36.4352) 
 
When a property is located in a condominium or planned unit development, the lender must 
ensure that any mandatory homeowner association assessment is subordinate to the VA-
guaranteed mortgage.

How to  HUD/USDA Approval 
Expedite VA  Generally, projects already approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
Approval  (HUD) or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) do not need further VA 
review.  Upon receipt of evidence of HUD/USDA approval, such as a copy of the 
HUD/USDA approved project list or the project approval letter, the VA office of jurisdiction 
adds the project to the nationwide VA list without issuing a formal VA approval letter. 
 
In rare cases, HUD or USDA may approve a project that VA discovers does not comply with 
VA regulations.  In those cases, VA notifies the lender as soon as practicable that it will not 
guarantee loans in the project. 
 
Use of Attorney’s Opinion 
This is a highly recommended options for condominiums that have not been approved by 
HUD or USDA. 
 
Reference:  See Section 16-B. 
 
Use of Previously Approved Documents 
When the organizational documents being submitted are essentially the same as a set 
previously approved by VA, the lender/sponsor should include a certification from the 
declarant or declarant’s attorney which 
 
 states the fact 
 specifically identifies the previous set, and 
 describes any variation to the previous set. 
 
State Agency Certification of a Condominium 
If a state agency certifies that the condominium has been created in compliance with the laws 
of the state in which it is located, include the certification.

6.  Contains provisions for amendment, (continued) 
 
g.  Provides that all other amendments (other than material amendments or extraordinary actions) must be 
approved by at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all members present, in person or by proxy, 
and voting at any meeting of the association at which a quorum is present (see subparagraph (4)(b)2 below 
(Bylaws)), or in writing by members entitled to cast at least a majority of the total authorized votes of all 
members of the association. 
 
7.  Grants each owner a non-exclusive easement of use and enjoyment in the common areas which is appurtenant 
to and passes with title to each unit.  Each owner also has a non-exclusive easement for egress and ingress over 
the common areas, to the extent necessary to provide access to the unit and for utilities serving that unit.  The 
right of access for necessary ingress and egress to the unit and utility services cannot be suspended by the board 
of directors for violations of the covenants or nonpayment of assessments.  The owner's easement rights may be 
subject to certain limitations (other limitations must be separately described by the attorney) as follows: 
 
a.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors, to mortgage the common areas subject to such 
member, mortgagee and agency approvals as may be provided in the declaration.  (A lender's rights, in the event 
of default upon any mortgage or deed of trust on the common areas, are limited to, after taking possession of 
such common areas, charging reasonable admission and other fees as a condition of continued enjoyment by 
members, and, if necessary, to a wider range of users.  Upon satisfaction of the mortgage or deed of trust, such 
common areas are returned to the association with full restoration of members' rights); 
 
b.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors to convey or transfer all or any part of the 
common areas, subject to such member, mortgagee and agency approvals as may be provided in the declaration; 
 
c.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors, without member, mortgagee and agency 
approvals unless provided otherwise in the declaration, to grant easements across the common areas for any 
purpose not inconsistent with the use of those areas by members;

7.  Non-exclusive easement,(continued) 
 
d.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors, without member, mortgagee and agency 
approvals unless provided otherwise in the declaration, to adopt regulations governing the use of common areas 
and the personal conduct of owners, occupants and guests thereon; 
 
e.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors,  without member, mortgagee and agency 
approvals unless otherwise provided in the declaration, to charge reasonable admission or other fees for special 
or extraordinary uses of the common areas; 
 
f.  Right of the association, acting through the board of directors, without member, mortgagee or agency 
approvals unless otherwise provided in the declaration, and consistent with existing local jurisdiction’s zoning 
and subdivision ordinances, to transfer part of the common areas for the purpose of adjusting lot lines in 
accordance with reasonably stated provisions (i.e., does not reduce total open space area below zoning 
requirements, does not materially affect development plan on file with an agency, and all units previously 
adjacent to common areas - remain so located, unless the owners of the units approve the boundary line 
adjustment); 
 
g.  Right of the board of directors without member, mortgagee or agency approvals unless otherwise provided in 
the declaration, to suspend the right of any member, and the rights of such member's household, tenants, guests 
and invitees to use recreational facilities or other common areas (to the extent that access and utility service are 
not impaired) for a period not to exceed 60 days, unless such rights are suspended for failure to pay 
assessments, in which case such rights may be suspended until the assessments are fully paid; or 
 
h.  Special declarant rights reserved by the declarant, (i) such as: right to use portions of the common areas for 
sales and marketing purposes; (ii) reservation of easements across the common areas for development purposes; 
(iii) right to grant, terminate or vacate easements across common areas for limited purposes such as installation 
and maintenance of utilities, storm water management or provision of services to units. 
 
8.  Contains provisions for maintaining the common areas.  If the association maintains areas it does not own (such 
as within a public right-of way for landscaping or signage or storm water management), the attorney must 
provide an explanation which describes the arrangement and discusses the rationale.

Exhibit A:  Other VA Requirements, 
Continued 
  
(A)  Declaration (continued) 
 
9.  Contains provisions for the adoption of an annual operating budget and imposition and collection of 
assessments to meet the expenses of the association.  The board of directors has the power on behalf of the 
association to levy both annual and additional assessments.  
 
a.  Units of a similar nature, receiving similar services, are assessed on a uniform basis except for the reduced 
assessment permitted for unoccupied units owned by the declarant or a builder.  If a different basis is used 
which allocates assessment liability among unit based on different services provided to the units or the different 
nature of the units, the rationale for that basis must be fully explained. 
 
b.  If the declarant furnishes a multi-year feasibility budget, the declarant and/or a builder may pay a reduced 
annual assessment on unoccupied lots only provided that such reduced assessment is not less than 25% of the 
full annual assessment.  Alternatively, the declarant or builder may pay a one-time assessment equal to 25 
percent of the applicable annual assessment per lot based upon the first year budget at maximum build-out (or 5 
years out for projects involving 250 or more lots/units).  The lots for which the one-time assessment has been 
paid may be exempt from further assessment until the earlier of: (i) initial occupancy or (ii) two fiscal years 
after submission to the declaration.  If unoccupied units are receiving the benefit of the reduced or one-time 
assessment, the documents provide that the declarant, or builder(s) as appropriate, must provide for or pay for 
all maintenance to such units and shall fund all operating budget deficits incurred during the declarant control 
period, including reserves based upon expected lives of items for which reserved, but not including shortfalls 
caused by nonpayment of assessments by other members or extraordinary expenditures (e.g., expenses caused 
by natural catastrophes or environmental hazards).  A unit initially occupied or conveyed to a unit owner other 
than the declarant or a builder is fully assessed.  The obligation to fund budget deficits is a lien against all the 
land owned by the declarant (or the declarant and builders) in the planned unit development.

10. If a maximum annual assessment is stated, the maximum may increase automatically by the greater of ten 
percent or based upon a Consumer Price Index, such as the U.S. Department of Urban Price Index - All Urban 
Consumers (1982-84=100) or other comparable index reflecting the association’s cost increase experience each 
year.  The maximum may also be increased by a majority vote of the members obligated to pay such assessment 
or with the written approval of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number of authorized votes of 
members obligated to pay such assessment (in both cases excluding the declarant during the declarant control 
period).  Increases in certain fixed costs for insurance, taxes, recycling or waste disposal may be passed through 
to the members, by permitting an automatic increase in the maximum assessment which reflects those increases.  
If no maximum assessment is set forth, a vote of the members must be required to approve capital expenditures, 
other than for repair and replacement, during a fiscal year of more than 20 percent of the budget for common 
expenses for that fiscal year. 
 
11. Contains provisions for a lien-supported assessment.  The assessment lien of any assessment levied by the 
association is subordinate to the lien of a first mortgage (Title 38, USC, section 3703(d)(3)).  Subordination to 
other security interests or liens is acceptable if permitted by applicable law.  The sale or transfer of any unit 
pursuant to mortgage foreclosure of a first mortgage or any proceeding in lieu thereof extinguishes the lien of 
such assessments as to payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer.  No sale or transfer relieves 
such unit from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.  (NOTE: VA will 
not recognize any limited priority that common expense assessments may have over the first mortgage lien.  
Mortgage holders should be aware that no VA claim payment will be made to holders for any payments they 
may have made to clear prior liens for delinquent and unpaid association assessments).

12. Contains provisions for collection of assessments.  The interest rate permitted to be charged by the association 
is uniform, reasonable and non-usurious.  The method of determining the interest rate is set forth.  A rate not to 
exceed that charged by the Internal Revenue Service on delinquent taxes is considered reasonable.  The 
association has the power both to foreclose the association's lien and to bring a legal action against the member 
personally obligated to pay the assessment.  The documents may provide that a successor in title is entitled to 
obtain an association disclosure statement or estoppel certificate with respect to common expense assessments, 
in which case an owner's personal obligation to pay assessments is assumed by successors in title unless the 
successor in title acquired title through foreclosure, or any proceeding in lieu thereof, of a first mortgage.  
(NOTE: Units which will be subject to a VA-guaranteed loan will not be subject to delinquent assessments in 
excess of 6 months in any case in which the association has not brought enforcement action against the current 
unit owner.) 
 
13. Contains provisions for enforcement of the association documents.  If owners are held liable for costs and 
expenses incurred by the association as a result of acts or omissions of such owner or such owner’s tenants, 
agents, employees, invitees, guests and household members in failing to comply with the association documents 
or rules or regulations of the association, regardless of negligence or culpability,  then the Public Offering 
Statement and or Information Brochure must describe this matter. 
 
14. Contains provisions requiring appropriate types of insurance.  The board of directors, on behalf of the 
association, has the authority to and is required to obtain coverages in the areas of property damage, liability, 
and personnel.  Owners may be required to maintain certain types of insurance coverages and, if the owner fails 
to purchase that insurance, the board may obtain those coverages at the owner’s expense.  All hazard and flood 
insurance policies which include any units, must also have the standard mortgagee clause and provide for notice 
to the mortgagee at least ten days before lapse, material modification or cancellation of the policy. 
 
15. Contains provisions for reconstruction of the common areas after condemnation or casualty loss.

16. Contains provisions governing parking, if parking is not included within each unit.  If vehicular parking is on 
the common areas: (i) the association documents must:  (a) permanently assign a parking space on the common 
area to each unit; (b) assign a specific parking area to a specific group of units or (c) make other provisions 
assuring parking in compliance with local ordinances; or (ii) the declarant must provide other evidence of 
parking in compliance with local ordinances. 
 
17. Contains provisions guaranteeing mortgagees (may be limited to eligible mortgagees, as defined below) and 
agencies notice of amendments.  During the declarant control period: (i) the declarant must provide a copy of all 
amendments to VA; and (ii) the association may not make any material amendments or take any extraordinary 
actions as described in subparagraph 6 above without the approval of VA.  The declaration may provide that 
certain rights and protections (including notice and approval rights) are granted to only those mortgagees who 
have provided notice to the board of directors of their interest and requested all rights under the association 
documents “eligible mortgagees.”  Rights granted to eligible mortgagees should include the following: 
 
a.  Right to inspect association documents and records on the same terms as the members; 
 
b.  Notice of all material amendments to the association documents; 
 
c.  Notice of any extraordinary actions of the association; 
 
d.  Notice of any property loss, condemnation or eminent domain proceeding affecting the common areas 
resulting in losses greater than 10 percent of the annual budget or any unit insured by the association in which 
the mortgagee has an interest; 
 
e.  Notice of any termination, lapse or material modification of an insurance policy held by the association; 
 
f.  Notice of any default by an owner of a unit subject to a mortgage held by the eligible mortgagee in paying 
assessments or charges to the association which remains uncured for sixty consecutive days;

i.  Right of a majority of the eligible mortgagees to demand an audit of the association's financial records. 
 
18. Contains provisions for party walls, if a townhouse planned community.  The association documents or law of 
the jurisdiction must provide for the maintenance, repair and reconstruction of party walls and allocate the costs 
among the owners served by a party wall. 
 
19. Contains provisions for expansion or annexation in a phased development.  The declaration must, in addition to 
submitting at least 1 phase to the covenants and restrictions: (i) describe the additional land proposed to be 
submitted in the future in a sufficient manner to locate the property; (ii) grant the declarant the right to submit 
the described additional land; (iii) describe the method of submitting additional land; d describe the basis of 
voting rights and assessment obligations of units added in relation to the voting rights and assessment 
obligations of units already subject to the declaration or provide that such rights for future phases will be the 
same as for phases already submitted; and establish a reasonable time limit for submitting additional land.  A 
reasonable time limit will depend on the size of the development, but generally annexation made within the later 
of 7 years after recordation of the Declaration or 5 years after the most recent recordation of an annexation 
document is considered reasonable.  The additional land must be contiguous, adjacent or across a public right-
of-way.  If the additional land is not so located, there must be a clear statement of that fact and a discussion of 
the rationale for its potential inclusion.  The declaration may reserve the right to the declarant to submit a 
limited amount of undescribed adjacent additional land, increasing the total size of the planned community by 
up to 10 percent both in land size and number of additional units, or such undescribed additional land may be 
added by the association with a majority vote of the members at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is 
present or the written consent of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number of votes, in both cases 
excluding the votes of the declarant during the declarant control period.

VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised    Chapter 17:  VA Sanctions Against Program Participants 
Chapter 17 
VA Sanctions Against Program Participants 
Overview 
 
Introduction  VA is authorized to impose sanctions against persons or entities who take 
actions which are detrimental to the VA loan guaranty program.  The type and 
severity of the sanction imposed is based on 
 
 the type of participant (for example, lender, builder, management broker, 
etc.), and

Unfair  Unfair marketing practices include, but are not limited to 
Marketing   
Practices   enforcement of unfair contractual provisions 
 requiring purchasers to execute so-called “contracts” which legally bind the

to the purchasers 
 
Example:  limiting a seller’s liability to the refund of the earnest money 
deposit 
 
 advertising that a property or project is “VA guaranteed” or “VA approved” 
or “VA inspected” in such a way as to lead veterans to believe that VA 
guarantees the construction and workmanship 
Note:  “VA financing available,” “Eligible for VA financing,” or similar 
advertising is acceptable. 
 
 delaying tactics on the part of the builder to postpone completion of the 
property or the closing of the sale after completion in an effort to induce the 
veteran to agree to a modification of a firm contract such as 
 the substitution of inferior materials 
 the omission of appliances, or 
 an increase in price. 
 
 failure of the seller or agent of the seller of proposed or newly constructed

Chapter 18:  Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) 
 
1.  Purpose and Eligibility Requirements 
 
a. Purpose of  Servicers of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guaranteed loans may be 
SAPP  granted authority, under Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP), to 
review liquidation appraisals, and issue the Notice of Value (NOV) without 
VA involvement.  The servicer exercises its SAPP authority through an 
employee who is VA-approved as a SAPP Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR).  
Once a SAR has satisfied the SAPP training and initial case review 
requirements (see section 3 of this chapter), their SAPP authority may be used 
for eligible properties (those secured by VA-guaranteed loans) in any location 
within the United States and its territories.  The purpose of SAPP is to reduce 
the time required for servicers of VA loans to receive the NOV.  
 
Important:  It is the SAR’s responsibility to stay informed about any local 
VA processing requirements unique to the VA jurisdiction in which a 
property is located. 
 
b. Servicer  To be granted SAPP authority, the servicer must have:  
Eligibility   
Requirements 
 a VA servicer identification number (ID), 
 an association with a single lender having a VA lender ID, and 
 an effective quality control (QC) system that ensures the adequacy and 
quality of its SARs.  (See section 6 of this chapter.) 
 
Note:  Under SAPP, a servicer may only have an association with a single 
lender. 
 
c. SAR  The servicer exercises its SAPP authority through an employee who is a VA-
Eligibility  approved SAR.  A SAR must: 
Requirements   
 be a full-time salaried employee of the lender/servicer, and  
 have at least three years of work experience that qualifies him or her to 
competently perform administrative appraisal reviews.

Chapter 18:  Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) 
1.  Purpose and Eligibility Requirements, 
Continued 
  
c. SAR  The SAR’s work experience must indicate that he or she has: 
Eligibility   
Requirements 
 general knowledge of the principles, methods, practices, and techniques of 
(continued) 
appraising and the ability to apply that knowledge, 
 the ability to review the work of others and recognize deviations from 
accepted appraisal principles and practices, 
 the ability to detect errors in computations, and 
 the ability to detect conclusions that are not supported. 
 
It is also desirable for the SAR to have knowledge of general realty practices 
and principles related to real property valuation, skill in collecting and 
assembling data, and the ability to prepare clear and concise reports. 
 
Note:  Three years experience related to the Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) Direct Endorsement (DE) program satisfies the experience 
requirement, provided all other application requirements are satisfied. 
 
d. SAR  There must be no conflict of interest between the SAR’s role and any other 
Conflicts of  activities that he or she conducts.  Examples of other activities that would 
Interest  constitute a conflict of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 
 the SAR being on the VA fee appraisal panel, or 
 the SAR being employed by or performing appraisal review services for 
another lender/servicer.

2.  Applying for Authority 
  
a. Application  The nominating senior officer of the servicer and the nominee must jointly 
and Fees  complete the Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) application. 
 
SAR applicants must attach a resume showing they possess the three years 
requisite experience outlined in section 1 of this chapter. 
 
A $100 processing fee must accompany the application package.   
  
b. Notification  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Central Office will review the 
of VA Decision  application and send a letter of preliminary approval or rejection.  In some 
cases, VA will need to request additional information from both the nominee 
and the senior officer in order to make a determination. 
 
Receipt of a letter of preliminary approval will authorize the nominee to 
schedule Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SAR training.  
  
c. SAR ID  VA will issue a permanent identification (ID) number for each SAR 
Number  approved.  The SAR always retains the same ID number, even when 
employed by a different servicer.   
 
When a SAR already has a Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) 
SAR ID number, the number will also be used as the SAPP SAR ID. 
 
d. SAR  If a SAR begins work for a new servicer, the SAR’s SAPP authority 
Employed By  automatically ceases and does not transfer to the new servicer.  To reinstate 
New Servicer  the SAR’s SAPP authority, the new servicer employer must promptly submit 
to VA: 
 
 a new SAPP application, and 
 a $100 processing fee. 
 
The servicer may request a waiver for the training and case review 
requirements for that SAR by including: 
 
 the SAR’s VA-issued ID number on the application, and  
 a statement that the SAR has processed SAPP cases within the last year.

3.  Training and Initial Test Case Reviews   
  
a. Requirements  Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SARs) with preliminary approval may not 
independently review liquidation appraisal reports and issue liquidation 
Notice of Values (NOVs), without the involvement of Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA), until they receive final approval.  To obtain final 
approval, the SAR must complete the following: 
 
 attend Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SAR training, and  
 successfully complete five initial test cases to demonstrate comprehension 
of VA liquidation appraisal review requirements to VA’s satisfaction. 
 
VA Central Office staff will provide SAPP SAR training at the request of the 
servicer and VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) staff will conduct the initial 
test case reviews.   
 
b. Test Case  Upon completion of SAR training, SARs may begin submitting their test 
Procedures  cases in The Appraisal System (TAS) for VA review.  Only one test case 
should be pending at any time; SARs should not submit an additional test 
case until the results of a previously submitted test case are known.  RLC 
staff will notify the SAR about the results of the review.  The RLC staff 
performing the review of test cases must complete the liquidation appraisal 
review and issue the NOV within five workdays from the date the case is 
submitted by the SAR.   
 
The following table outlines the steps for processing SAPP SAR test cases.  
Please note that these are the same steps for processing any SAPP cases, 
except for the requirement of VA involvement. 
 
Step  Description 
1  SAR accesses the VA E-Appraisal application in the Veterans 
Information Portal (VIP or Portal) and retrieves a SAPP appraisal.  
(Only SAPP appraisals associated with the SAR’s company may 
be retrieved.) 
2  SAR reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques, and for 
compliance with applicable VA directives and general and 
liquidation appraisal requirements in chapter 11. 
 
The SAR must resolve any concerns with the appraiser. (Report 
any contact with the appraiser and the results in “Processing 
Notes” when issuing the NOV.)

Continued 
 
b. Test Case Procedures (continued) 
  
Step  Description 
3  SAR determines the as-is value of the property, which must be 
supported by the reviewed appraisal report. (Make entries in 
“Processing Notes” to clarify or justify actions that are not self-
explanatory.) 
4  SAR accesses TAS in VIP, selects “Issue Liquidation NOV,” and 
inputs the required data to generate an NOV.  (TAS will not allow 
SARs with preliminary approval to issue NOVs; they may only be 
saved as NOV test cases awaiting review by the RLC.  (Upon 
receipt of SAR final approval, TAS will allow issuance of the 
NOV without VA involvement.) 
 
Note: The SAR must notify the RLC of jurisdiction when a test 
case has been submitted in TAS. 
5  VA RLC staff will review the following for all test cases and a 
percentage of subsequent cases:  
 
 appraisal report, 
 any related documents, 
 the saved test case NOV, and  
 processing notes, for any contacts with the appraiser, processing 
delays and clarification and/or justification of processing actions.  
6  VA staff will issue the NOV.  The SAR will be notified of the 
result(s) of the VA test case review and the SAR’s performance 
file will be documented. 
 
c. Continuing  As needed, VA will notify SAPP SARs of supplemental training 
Education by  opportunities or additional training requirements.

4.  Servicer Responsibilities 
  
a. SAPP  Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) authority is a privilege 
Privilege  delegated to servicers at VA’s discretion.  Servicers maintain this privilege by 
complying with all applicable SAPP-related requirements, including: 
 
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policies and procedures, 
 VA regulations, and 
 statutory requirements. 
 
Furthermore, servicers are expected to exercise due diligence in processing 
SAPP cases.  VA considers due diligence to be care that is properly expected 
from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent servicer that is 
entirely dependent on the subject property as a security to protect its 
investment.  
 
If VA finds proper cause, the privilege extended to servicers under SAPP may 
be: 
 
 amended, 
 suspended, or 
 withdrawn. 
 
Reference:  For more information, refer to chapter 17. 
 
b. Servicer and  The servicer must notify VA Central Office if: 
SAR Changes   
 there is a change in ownership, merger, or acquisition, or 
 a SAR is no longer employed or is no longer functioning as a SAR for the 
servicer.  (In such cases, the SAR’s SAPP authority automatically ceases 
and the servicer’s eligibility to participate in SAPP is terminated if that 
individual was the servicer’s only SAR on staff.)

5.  Processing Procedures 
 
a. Property  The subject property must be secured by a Department of Veterans Affairs 
Eligibility  (VA) guaranteed loan that is proceeding toward liquidation. 
 
b. Appraisal  Servicers will request the appraisal in The Appraisal System (TAS) by 
Request  completing VA Form 26-1805, VA Request for Determination of Reasonable 
Value.  TAS will automatically notify the assigned appraiser via e-mail when 
the liquidation appraisal assignment is made.   
 
Servicers may authorize parties to order appraisals on their behalf (i.e., law 
firms).  Those parties must register in the Veterans Information Portal (VIP) 
under their own name as an “Other Requestor.” 
If the agent…  Then…

Program (SAPP) servicer and is 
authorized by that servicer, 
requests an appraisal,  he or she must use his or her own 
log-in identification (ID) to request 
appraisals.  An appraisal cannot be 
requested unless the sponsoring 
servicer is known at the time of the 
request. 
 
Note:  In requesting an appraisal, the

required certifications on behalf of

was uploaded in E-Appraisal. 
 
Note:  When making the request, be sure to provide accurate information on 
the location of the keys to a vacant property in item 24 of VA Form 26-1805, 
VA Request for Determination of Reasonable Value, as well as the telephone 
number of the party requesting the liquidation appraisal in item 40.  This may 
require additional instructions from servicers when referring cases to 
foreclosing attorneys, if the attorneys are the parties ordering the liquidation 
appraisals.

Continued 
 
c. Access to  VA requires fee appraisers to gain access to vacant properties when 
Property by  performing VA liquidation appraisals in order to determine accurate values.  
Appraiser  If the fee appraiser is unable to gain access to a vacant property, the appraiser 
should use the contact information provided in item 40 of VA Form 26-1805, 
VA Request for Determination of Reasonable Value.  Servicers’ timely 
responses to any telephone inquiries help to limit delays in completion of 
appraisals for those cases where an appraiser encounters problems accessing 
the vacant property. 
 
If the appraiser still cannot gain access, he or she must document the actions 
taken to obtain access to the subject vacant property in an e-mail to the 
Construction & Valuation (C&V) section of jurisdiction.  C&V will then 
forward the appraiser’s email to the Regional Loan Center’s Loan 
Administration Officer, who will forward it to the appropriate servicer 
personnel.   
 
Time delays caused by an appraiser’s inability to access a property can result 
in postponed liquidation sales.  Because such delays are beyond the control of 
the appraiser, C&V “stops the clock” on the appraiser’s timeliness 
requirements until access is obtained.  However, in most cases, VA does not 
view delays as beyond the control of the servicer, and therefore the servicer 
may suffer curtailment of interest on the loan if a sale cannot be completed 
timely due to delays in the appraiser obtaining access to a property. 
 
d. Liquidation  For details about VA liquidation appraisal requirements, see section 13 of 
Appraisal  chapter 11. 
Requirements 
 
e. Submitting  If a SAR is reluctant to issue the Notice of Value (NOV) due to the difficulty 
Cases to VA for  or complexity of the case, the SAR may request that the VA Regional Loan 
Processing  Center (RLC) of jurisdiction issue the NOV.

d. QC Review  QC reviews should consider: 
Criteria   
 the overall quality of the SAR’s appraisal review, and

2.  Misleading Advertisements 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 
a. Policy  The Department of Veterans Affairs always strives to provide all veterans the 
most up-to-date and pertinent information about their benefits.  Toward that 
end, all appropriate efforts by lenders to further educate or remind veterans 
about their home loan benefit and the lender’s availability to assist the veteran 
in obtaining the benefit is appreciated.  However, it is inappropriate to direct 
any information about benefits to veterans which is in any way misleading. 
 
It must be clearly understood that VA has a very specific mission to serve 
veterans, who are declared by Congress to be a “special class of citizen,” and 
veterans rely on VA to provide dependable service and reliable information 
concerning their benefits.   
 
Any action on the part of lenders or other program participants which 
jeopardizes VA’s credibility with veterans or induces veterans to obtain loans 
which are clearly not in their best interests would be viewed by VA as actions 
which are detrimental to the best interests of veterans.  If such a determination 
is made, grounds for suspension from participation in the VA Loan Guaranty 
Program could be established. 
 
b. Examples  Example 1: 
 
In increasing numbers, VA has been receiving inquiries and complaints from 
veterans concerning advertisements and solicitations they have received from 
lenders which state that VA has a new program to refinance their VA loan 
and lower their interest rate, an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan 
(IRRRL).   
 
The IRRRL program has been available to veterans since the enactment of 
The Veterans’ Disability Compensation and Housing Benefits Amendments 
of 1980 (Public Law 96-385).   
 
In addition, many of these solicitations suggest that the lender has some 
special relationship with VA that enables only them to offer this loan 
opportunity.  Some even clearly attempts to give the impression that the 
“letter” the veteran received came from VA.

2.  Misleading Advertisements, 
Continued 
  
b. Examples  Example 2: 
(continued)  Another unacceptable advertising approach that some lenders have been using 
is to invite veterans to “skip” payments and refinance their loan.  It generally 
gives the appearance that VA condones skipping payments and rolling them 
into the new IRRRL. This is not the case. 
   
It is irresponsible to suggest to any mortgagor that this program encourages 
skipping payments, or that this is an appropriate means of getting around the 
prohibition against receiving cash from the transaction.   
 
Any advertising that promotes skipping payments as a means of obtaining 
cash for other purposes is unacceptable. 
 
c. Lender  VA encourages all lenders to continue offering VA financing to all eligible 
Responsibility  and qualified veterans, and it is recognized that mortgage lending is a 
competitive industry.  However, VA insists that lenders refrain from any and 
all practices which might mislead veterans into actions which are contrary to 
their own best interests.   
 
If your firm has been engaging in such advertising, or is considering doing so, 
VA strongly recommends that anything in your promotional material which is 
in any way inaccurate or misleading be deleted.  If there is uncertainty about 
the accuracy or propriety of the advertisement or solicitation, please consult 
with the appropriate local VA office or the Loan Policy staff at VA Central 
Office at (202) 273-7368. 
 
d. Sanctions  Sanctions of program participants for violations of regulations are set forth in 
38 CFR part 44.   Refer to Chapter 17 for additional information on sanctions 
of program participants.

3.  Automated Underwriting 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
 This section has been changed to create subsection lettering. 
 Subsection a has been changed to add a reference to the Zippy program. 
 Subsection c’s reference to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s automated 
underwriting systems has been changed to “provider of these systems.”  
This change is due to the increase in the number of approved systems. 
 
a. General  VA has approved the use of several automated underwriting systems.  The 
systems are 
 
 Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, 
 Fannie Mae’s DU, 
 Countrywide’s CLUES System, and 
 Chase’s Zippy 
 
Note:  The Chase and Countrywide systems may only be used in connection 
with their loans.  
 
The systems are only for use by VA automatic lenders, and only on loans 
eligible for automatic processing.   
 
These systems assign a risk classification which determines the level of 
underwriting and documentation needed. 
 
b. Lender  The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely 
Responsibility  determine a risk classification.  It is still the lender’s decision whether or not 
to approve the loan.   
 
Lenders are still responsible for meeting all VA requirements for all loans; 
however they may take advantage of certain documentation waivers based on 
the risk classification. 
 
c. VA’s Role  Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor. 
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these systems.

4.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 
a.  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, 
Compatibility  many lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate 
of VA Program  measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to 
with HMDA 
home mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be 
aware of how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in 
meeting this goal. 
 
The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for 
individuals with low-to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such applicants.  The “VA Credit Standards” are written as guidelines and 
are meant to be interpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration 
all of an individual loan applicant’s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.   
 
This topic provides guidance on areas of underwriting that may be of 
particular concern when processing applications for low-to-moderate income 
borrowers.  Many of the concepts are discussed in Chapter 4, Credit 
Underwriting, but are repeated here to emphasize their importance and 
applicability to underwriting loans to minority and low-to-moderate income 
applicants. 
 
b. Purpose  This topic in the “VA Lender's Handbook” is intended to encourage 
underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which ought to be 
approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of the credit 
standards.  The examples discussed are certainly not all inclusive, but they 
should help the underwriter recognize that there are those whose lifestyle, 
minority status, or location require consideration of extraordinary, yet valid, 
factors in the underwriting process in order to find a basis for correctly 
making an approval decision. 
 
Underwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications 
for every qualified veteran.

c. Use of VA  Although lenders that have automatic authority should use that authority to 
Prior Approval  the maximum extent possible, another important tool available to lenders 
Procedure  seeking to increase credit access by minority and lower income borrowers is 
the optional use of VA’s prior-approval processing.   
 
Loan applications that may not be clearly approvable under VA’s published 
credit standards but which, in the lender’s view, contain compensating 
strengths, may be sent to VA on the prior-approval basis.  Lenders should 
submit an explanation as to why the loan was not closed automatically and 
point out the reasons why they believe the loan may be approvable. 
 
d. Employment  A borrower’s employment and income stability are vital to the underwriting 
and Income  of a loan.  There are characteristics that should be considered when 
Stability  underwriting loans for low-to-moderate income borrowers when evaluating 
acceptable employment and income. 
 
Changing of Jobs 
It is possible to establish stable and reliable income without having 
established a stable employment history in one position or job.  It is not 
unusual for some borrowers to change jobs frequently, even changing lines of 
work.  The borrower may be simply going where there is available work.  To 
establish stability and continuance of income, the borrower must demonstrate 
the ability to maintain an income at a constant level over the recent 2-year 
period even if he or she has worked for a variety of employers. 
 
Part-Time Employment 
It is not uncommon for people with limited income from their primary 
employment to take on part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  Ideally 
the borrower should show a two-year history, but one year may be considered 
for an otherwise strong borrower.  Underwriters must review such income for 
probable continuance and try to assure that the part-time employment is 
reasonable and sustainable.

d. Employment  Periods of Unemployment 
and Income  In parts of the country, it is not unusual for some individuals to work for 
Stability  certain times of the year and draw unemployment for the remainder of the 
(continued) 
year (such as field workers).  A period or periods of unemployment will not 
automatically be considered unfavorably, provided the unemployment is 
regular and seasonal, or is a limited occurrence between jobs, and 
unemployment compensation has been received during those periods.  If the 
applicant has a history of such an income pattern, unemployment 
compensation as well as income received during periods of employment may 
be used when calculating an individual’s income for loan approval purposes. 
  
e. Source of  Another area where low-to-moderate income borrowers sometimes differ 
Funds to Close  from others is the source of funds to close loans.  It is not unusual or 
unacceptable for some borrowers to save money at home versus using 
depositories.  In order to be acceptable, a reasonable explanation of how the 
borrower saved the funds should be provided. 
 
f. Credit  In the area of credit, the lack of an established credit history should not be a 
History  deterrent to loan approval.  As provided in the credit standards, a satisfactory 
payment history on items such as rent, utilities, phone bills, etc., may be used 
to establish a satisfactory credit history.

g. Consider All  As stated in the credit standards, no single factor is a determinant in any 
Factors  applicant’s qualification for a VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
 A veteran who has maintained an excellent credit history, (such as 
satisfactory payment of a shelter expense comparable to the proposed 
shelter expense) may be approvable in spite of shortfall in the residual 
income.  In such an instance, it might be appropriate to consider that the 
veteran has established a lifestyle which is substantially different from the 
average used in establishing the residual income tables in the credit 
standards. 
 A veteran with a good credit record who meets the residual income 
guideline (without exceeding it by 20 percent) may be approvable in spite 
of a high debt-to-income ratio if the proposed shelter expense is not 
significantly greater than the amount the veteran has been accustomed to 
paying. 
 
h.  The use of compensating factors is encouraged for marginally approvable VA 
Compensating  loans, and a detailed explanation of their use in underwriting loans is 
Factors  provided in the credit standards.   
 
A compensating factor that has come into play quite recently is the numerous 
financial and homeownership counseling programs being provided by a 
variety of sources including banks, mortgage lenders, and community groups.  
These counseling programs are designed to help applicants work out payment 
plans for old debts, design savings plans, and teach basic budgeting skills.  
Programs often include homebuyer education lessons and post-closing 
counseling to assist the new homeowners once the loan is made.  Participation 
by an applicant in such a counseling program can be viewed as a strong 
compensating factor for a case in which it is otherwise difficult to conclude 
that a borrower is qualified under a traditional interpretation of the credit 
standards.

5.  VA Restructuring of the Loan Processing Function 
 
Changed Date  September 15, 2004, Change 4 
 This section has been changed to create subsection lettering.  
 Subsection a has been created by combining the two previous subsections 
into one.  This new subsection encourages lenders to use their automatic 
authority in every possible instance before submitting a loan to VA for 
underwriting. 
 
a. Use of Prior  Lenders with automatic authority must use their automatic authority in every 
Approval  possible instance before submitting a loan to VA for underwriting on the prior 
Processing by  approval basis.   
Automatic 
 
Lenders 
Except for cases specifically precluded from automatic processing, such as 
joint loans, the only cases lenders should consider submitting to VA for prior 
approval are those in which the underwriter firmly believes approval can be 
justified.  However, the specific facts of the case appear to preclude approval.  
In such instances, the underwriter must include: 
 
 a detailed explanation of why the loan should be approved by VA, plus 
 a thorough justification for not approving the loan on the automatic basis.   
 
It will not be sufficient to justify submitting the loan to VA solely to comply 
with the veteran’s or the real estate agent’s request to do so.

The lender may download a copy of this VA Pamphlet 26-7, Lender’s 
Handbook, at http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/pam26_7.html. 
 
To receive new lender information from the VA, including updates to this 
manual, the lender will need to sign up for GovDelivery at

The VA RLC of jurisdiction will serve as the lender’s primary contact point 
with VA.  Please direct all technical questions, requests for training, or 
requests for VA publications and materials to that office. 
 
As soon as a lender becomes familiar with the laws, regulations, and 
procedures pertaining to VA-guaranteed loans, it may begin making VA 
loans. 
 
A non-supervised lender must submit all loans except certain IRRRLs to VA 
for prior approval, unless the lender applies for, and receives, specific 
authority from VA to close loans on the automatic basis. 
 
A lender supervised by one of the Federal entities described in Topic 3 of this 
chapter can begin closing loans on the automatic basis immediately. 
 
A lender that must submit a request to VA for recognition as supervised must 
submit all loans except certain IRRRLs to VA for prior approval until it 
receives recognition as supervised. See Topic 3 of this chapter for more 
information.

d. If a Lender is  A supervised lender has the authority to close VA-guaranteed loans on an 
Supervised  automatic basis (without the prior approval of VA) except for certain types of 
loans that must be submitted to VA for prior approval by all lenders. 
 
These loan types are listed in Topic 1 of this chapter under “Prior Approval.” 
 
The supervised lender must obtain VA recognition of agents it uses to make 
VA loans. See Topic 7 of this chapter for more information. 
 
If the lender uses an agent, it must submit the following to the VA office with 
jurisdiction over its home office by January 31 of each year: 
 
 a list of the VA-recognized agency relationships it wishes to renew, 
 the annual renewal fee (see Topic 10 of this chapter) for each lender agent 
that acts for the lender and had been recognized by VA as the lender’s agent 
as of September 30 (120 days before payment is due), and 
 any other information requested by VA. 
 
Although VA offices may issue an annual reminder notice to lenders that the 
above information is due, lenders bear the ultimate responsibility for timely 
submission of the information and appropriate fees.  Failure to pay annual 
renewal fees could result in loss of a lender’s automatic processing authority.

The extent of the relationship between the lender and the agent is at the

 The lender must accept full responsibility for the acts, errors, or omissions 
of the agent in processing and/or closing loans. 
 The lender accepts this responsibility by certification on VA Form 26-1820,

resolution. 
 The lender may not subsequently claim that it should not be held 
accountable for inaccurate or fraudulent credit information or other loan 
data because it relied on the agent. 
 Irregularities resulting from acts or omissions of the agent are treated as acts 
or omissions of the lender. 
 The lender’s use of an agent will not prevent VA from taking actions in 
appropriate cases such as denial of liability, claim adjustments, collection of 
the amount of any loss incurred due to irregularities, and imposition of 
sanctions against both the lender and the agent.

Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. The Issue  Changes in ownership or corporate structure of a lender may impact its 
continued qualifications for automatic authority.  Lenders must notify VA 
whenever a merger, acquisition, or change in the ownership of the lender 
occurs, so that VA can evaluate any impact on the lender’s participation in the 
VA Home Loan program.  
 
Although only the terms “merger” and “acquisition” and “selling,” 
“acquiring” or “surviving” entities are used in this paragraph, the concepts 
and procedures in this paragraph apply to every type of restructuring that has 
a significant impact on an organization’s ownership, structure, or assets, and 
so on.

9.  Withdrawal of Automatic Authority from Supervised or 
Non-supervised Automatic Lenders 
   
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. General  VA can withdraw a lender’s automatic authority for proper cause, after giving 
the lender 30 days notice. This applies to both supervised and non-supervised 
lenders.  VA regulations at 38 CFR 36.4349 provide the framework.  The 
lender may continue processing loans on a prior approval basis after its 
automatic authority has been withdrawn. 
 
The remainder of this Topic gives the reasons a lender’s automatic authority 
can be withdrawn, and the corresponding period for which the withdrawal 
will be effective. 
  
b. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for an indefinite period can be based on any of the following: 
for an   
Indefinite  Failure to continue meeting basic qualifying criteria: 
Period 
 
  For supervised lenders, this includes loss of status as an entity subject 
to examination and supervision by a Federal or State regulatory 
agency. 
  For non-supervised lenders, this includes no approved underwriter, 
failure to maintain $50,000 working capital or $250,000 adjusted net 
worth, and/or failure to file the required financial statements. 
 
Any of the causes for debarment set forth in 38 CFR 44. 
 
During the probationary period for newly-approved non-supervised automatic 
lenders, automatic authority may be withdrawn for poor underwriting 
consistently careless processing, failure to provide loan files timely, or to 
provide other necessary documents as requested by VA.

income to qualify borrower or ignoring significant adverse credit items 
affecting applicant’s creditworthiness.   
 
 Employment or deposit verifications are hand carried by applicants or 
otherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands of a third party. 
 
 Consistently incomplete loan submissions after repeatedly being called to 
the lender’s attention. 
  
 Continued instances of disregard of VA requirements after repeatedly being

d. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for 180 days can be based on any of the following: 
for 180 Days   
 Loans conflict with VA credit standards and would not have been made by a 
lender acting prudently. 
 Failure to disclose to VA significant obligations or other information so 
material to the Veteran’s ability to repay the loan that undue risk to the 
Government results. 
 Employment or deposit verifications are hand carried by the applicant or 
otherwise mishandled, resulting in submission of significant misinformation 
to VA. 
 Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA 
requirements to Veterans to the detriment of their interests. 
 
Examples: 
  The Veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest rate based on 
lender’s incorrect advice that such options were excluded by VA  
requirements. 
 Closing documents show instances of improper charges to Veteran after 
the impropriety of such charges are called to lender’s attention by VA, or 
the lender refuses to refund such charges after notification by VA. 
 Other instances of lender actions prejudicial to the interests of Veterans 
such as deliberate delays in scheduling loan closings. 
 
 
e. Withdrawal  Withdrawal for 1 to 3 years can be based on any of the following:   
for 1 to 3   
Years   Failure to properly disburse loans, such as loan disbursement checks are 
returned due to insufficient funds. 
 
 Involvement by the lender in the improper use of a Veteran’s entitlement, 
such as knowingly permitting the Veteran to violate occupancy 
requirements. 
 
 Lender involvement in the Veteran’s sale of entitlement to a third party, 
such as a lender makes the loan with the knowledge that the Veteran is not 
purchasing the property to be his or her home.  Instead, the Veteran intends 
to transfer title to a third party who assumes the loan shortly after closing.

10.  Participation Fees for Supervised and Non-supervised 
Automatic Lenders 
  
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. Introduction  Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4348, VA is authorized to collect fees from lenders with 
automatic authority to help defray the costs of administering the VA Home 
Loan program.  Always submit fees to the RLC with jurisdiction over the 
lender’s home office.  Fees consist of annual participation fees, and 
administrative fees (for processing lender requests). 
 
If the lender submits a request for administrative action without the correct 
processing fee, VA will delay processing of the request until the fee is 
received.  
 
Fees are nonrefundable, even if the request is denied (except in cases of 
accidental overpayment).  
 
Pay all fees by lender’s check to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
 
If an agent, underwriter, or SAR approved by VA for a role with one lender 
begins work for another lender, the new lender must request and pay the fee 
for a new VA recognition or approval of that individual. 
  
b. Annual Fees  Remit fees within 120 days of the end of the lender’s fiscal year to the RLC 
for Non- with jurisdiction of the lender’s home office.  If the lender has ongoing VA-
supervised  recognized agency relationships, a list of agent relationships is required.

13.  Calculation of Adjusted Net Worth 
  
Change Date  February 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
  
a. Method  Net worth for VA purposes is determined by 38 C.F.R. §36.4352(b)(4)(ii). 
   
b. CPA  Adjusted net worth must be calculated by a CPA using an audited and 
Requirement  certified balance sheet from the lender’s latest financial statement, per the 
above regulation. 
  
c. Calculation  Adjusted net worth is total assets, minus total liabilities, minus the following 
unacceptable assets: 
 Any assets of the lender pledged to secure obligations of another person or 
entity. 
 Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender or related 
entities, in which the lender’s officers or stockholders have a personal 
interest, unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder.  Personal 
interest indicates a relationship between the lender and a person or entity in 
which that specified person has a financial interest in or is employed in a 
management position by the lender. 
 Any investment in related entities in which the lender’s officers or 
stockholders (or their family members) have a personal interest unrelated to 
their position as an officer or stockholder. 
 That portion of an investment in joint ventures, subsidiaries, affiliates 
and/or other related entities, which is carried at a value greater than equity, 
as adjusted (“equity, as adjusted” means the book value of the related entity 
reduced by the amount of unacceptable assets carried by the related entity). 
 All intangibles, such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, franchisee fees, 
organization costs, and so on, except unamortized servicing costs carried at 
a value established by an arm’s-length transaction and presented in 
accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles. 
 That portion of an asset not readily marketable and for which appraised 
values are very subjective carried at a value in excess of a substantially 
discounted appraised value.  Assets such as antiques, art work, and 
gemstones are subject to this provision and should be carried at the lower of 
cost or market. 
 Any asset that is principally used for the personal enjoyment of an officer or 
stockholder and not for normal business purposes.

Scope   
 Audits or reviews are not less than ten percent of all VA-guaranteed 
mortgages originated by the lender monthly, including its branches and 
authorized agents except that lenders making more than 140 VA mortgages 
monthly may use statistical sampling methods in lieu of the ten percent. 
 Loans processed by all loan officers and underwriters and a random 
selection which includes loans from all branch offices and authorized 
agents.   
 Procedures for expanding scope when fraudulent activity or patterns of 
deficiencies are identified.  
 For lenders participating in LAPP, that reviews include the QC procedures. 
 Procedures for validating third party verification data obtained through 
Automated Underwriting Systems (AUS). 
 For each branch office that originates VA loans, an on-site branch office 
review should be conducted at least once annually.

1.  How to Establish the Applicant’s Eligibility for a VA Loan 
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
a. What is  Eligibility means the Veteran meets the basic criteria of length of service 
Eligibility  (LOS) and character of service (COS) for the home loan benefit. Entitlement 
is the amount a Veteran has available for a guaranty on a loan.  An eligible 
Veteran must still meet credit and income standards in order to qualify for a 
VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
b. The  The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) issued in WebLGY is the proof of 
Lender’s Role  eligibility for the lender. 
 
The lender must ensure the applicant is an eligible Veteran before an appraisal 
is ordered, the loan cannot be processed or closed.  Lenders should never 
close a loan before they establish eligibility. VA cannot guarantee a loan for 
an ineligible Veteran.   
 
Once a COE is issued there may be conditions on the COE which must be met 
in order to receive a guaranty.  The conditions that could appear on the COE 
are: 
 
  Active Duty Service Member (ADSM) - Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of 
continuous active duty as of date of note is required. This COE is not 
valid if the ADSM was discharged after the date of the certificate. In 
this instance, a new COE must be obtained.   
  Funding Fee – Please fax a copy of VA Form 26-8937 to the Regional 
Loan Center (RLC) of Jurisdiction.  Please have the lender contact the 
RLC for loan processing. 
  Funding Fee – Veteran is not exempt from funding fee due to non-
service connected pension.  Loan application will require prior 
approval processing by VA.  
  Reserve or National Guard Member – Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to the date of this certificate.  A certification of 
continuous service in the Selected Reserve or National Guard as of the 
date of the note is required.

b. The    Reserve/National Guard Funding Fee – Entitlement is based on service 
Lender’s Role,  in the Selected Reserve and/or National Guard so an increased funding 
continued  fee is required. 
  Refinance Restoration – Restored entitlement previously used or 
charged for a VA Loan Indetification Number (LIN) as shown here is 
available only for use in connection with the property which secured 
that loan. 
  One-Time Restoration – Entitlement previously used for a VA LIN has 
been restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38 
U.S.C. 3702 (b)(4).  Any future restoration requires disposal of all 
property obtained with a VA loan. 
  Subsequent Use Funding Fee – Entitlement code of “5” indicates 
previously used entitlement has been restored.  The Veteran must pay a 
subsequent use funding fee on any future loan unless the Veteran is 
exempt. 
  Surviving Spouse – Eligibility of the surviving spouse and the validity 
of guaranty entitlement hereby evidenced will be null and void if any 
change in marital status occurs, subsequent to the date of this COE and 
prior to the date a loan to the widow or widower is closed, unless the 
lender making the loan was not aware of any change in marital status 
and obtained on the date the loan closed an affidavit from the surviving 
spouse in the form prescribed by the Secretary. 
  Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) – This certificate 
evidences eligibility under 38 U.S.C 3701 (b)(3) of the individual 
named as the spouse of a Servicemember missing in action or prisoner 
of war.  Any unused entitlement will terminate automatically upon the 
receipt of official notice that the Servicemember is no longer in a 
category specified in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(3) or upon dissolution of 
marriage. 
  Paid-in-Full Loan – Entitlement charged on a paid-in-full loan cannot 
be restored until the Veteran applies for restoration of entitlement.  The 
lender shall submit the application electronically through VA’s 
Automated Certificate of Eligibility (ACE) online application. 
  Foreclosed Loan – Entitlement charged on a foreclosed loan cannot be 
restored until VA’s loss on the loan has been fully repaid.  Information 
about repayment of the loss may be obtained by contacting an RLC.

b. The  Although this chapter discusses some of the basic eligibility criteria, it is not 
Lenders Role,  intended to provide a lender with all the knowledge necessary to make an 
continued  eligibility determination; consequently, all the various exceptions and nuances 
of eligibility are not included.  Appendix 1-A at the end of this chapter 
provides a quick reference and overview of basic eligibility criteria. 
 
Lenders must use VA’s ACE online application to obtain the COE. Go to 
VA’s Information Portal (VIP) and select WebLGY from the applications 
toolbar; then select Eligibility and follow the prompts.  In many cases, a COE 
can be generated in seconds.  If not, lenders should select the link to submit an 
electronic application.  This method allows lenders to upload supporting 
documentation and submit an application electronically to be processed by one 
of the RLCs. 
 
A Veteran can apply for a COE through eBenefits at 
http://www.ebenefits.va.gov or, if necessary, by completing VA Form 26- 
1880, Request for a Certificate of Eligibility and mailing it to the listed RLC.  
Simultaneous applications may delay COE processing. To ensure quicker 
responses, it is preferable to apply online. 
 
   
c. IRRRL  VA systems will not generate a VA case number for an Interest Rate 
Eligibility  Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL) if there is no record of an active VA 
Determination  loan.  This means if a lender successfully obtains a case number for an IRRRL, 
a COE is not required.

2. What the Certificate of Eligibility Tells the Lender 
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
   
The lender may rely on a COE as proof the Veteran is eligible for the home 
a. Eligibility 
loan benefit.  Although eligible for the home loan benefit, Veterans must still 
 
qualify based on income and credit before loan approval is granted. 
 
 
 
   
Entitlement is the amount available for use on a loan. The amount of basic 
b. Amount of 
entitlement is $36,000.  This may be reduced if a Veteran has used entitlement 
Entitlement 
before which has not been restored.  The amount of basic entitlement will be 
displayed near the center of the COE. For example it may say:    
                                                        
“THIS VETERAN’S BASIC ENTITLEMENT IS $_________ .  
TOTAL ENTITLEMENT CHARGED TO PREVIOUS VA 
LOANS IS $_______  .” 
 
For loans greater than $144,000, bonus entitlement may be available.  For 
loans greater than $144,000, but less than $484,350, the entitlement is 25 
percent.  For loans greater than $484,350, the maximum entitlement is 25 
percent of the loan limit, which can vary by county. For a list of loan limits by 
county, visit  http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/lenders.asp.  Please note 
county limits can change yearly.  VA will post the limits for each year on our 
website as they change. 
 
The Veteran may have entitlement for loans greater than 
$144,000, the COE does not reflect the bonus entitlement.  Instead, an asterisk 
by the word “available” refers to a note, which explains the possibility of 
additional entitlement. 
 
If the Veteran previously used entitlement, which has not been restored, 
available entitlement is reduced by the amount used on the prior loan(s).  The 
lender has three options in this situation: 
 
  Make the loan knowing that VA’s guaranty is limited to the amount of 
available entitlement, or 
  Have the Veteran apply for restoration of previously used entitlement, 
or 
  The Veteran may provide a downpayment in conjunction with their 
remaining entitlement.

3. How to Apply For A Certificate of Eligibility 
 
Change Date  March 28, 2019  
This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
a. Procedures  Lenders must first attempt to obtain a COE through the ACE application, 
which can be accessed through the VIP.   
 
If a COE cannot be obtained immediately, lenders should select the electronic 
application link that permits them to submit an electronic application. If the 
COE is issued with reduced entitlement and restoration is needed, use the 
“Correct COE” function to request an updated COE.   
 
The WebLGY system allows lenders to upload documentation, such as 
discharge papers or evidence to support restoration (Closing Disclosure, 
HUD-1 etc.), along with the electronic application. Lenders should not 
upload scanned documents without first completing an electronic application. 
Using this feature, rather than mail, is the preferred method, as it greatly 
reduces processing time. 
 
  Inability to obtain a COE in WebLGY does not mean the Veteran is 
ineligible, only that the system does not have sufficient information to 
make an automatic determination.  Lenders should always continue the 
application process as described in the preceding paragraph. 
  Application for an Unmarried Surviving Spouses. A surviving spouse 
of a Veteran, who dies on active duty or from service-connected 
causes, may still be eligible for a COE.  If the surviving spouse is 
remarried on or after age 57, and on or after December 16, 2003, they 
still may be eligible.  Eligibility may also be granted to the spouse of 
an active duty member who is listed as MIA or POW for at least 90 
days.  Eligibility under this MIA/POW provision is limited to one-time 
use only.

a. Procedures,  a)  Surviving spouses of Veterans who died from non-service connected 
continued  causes may also be eligible if any of the following conditions are 
met:  (1) the Veteran was rated totally disabled for 10 years or more 
immediately preceding death; or (2) was rated totally disabled for 
not less than 5 years from date of discharge or release from active 
duty to date of death, or (3) the Veteran was a former POW who 
died after September 30, 1999, and was rated totally disabled for not 
less than 1 year immediately preceding death. The above eligibility 
requirements are determined by VA Compensation Department.  
Once completed, they will determine if the surviving spouse is 
eligible for qualifying Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC).  
b)  If applying for the first time, surviving spouses must complete VA 
Form 26-1817, Request for Determination of Loan Guaranty 
Eligibility-Unmarried Surviving Spouses, instead of VA Form 26-
1880.

  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Discharged  The DD214 Form, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty, will 
Veterans  generally contain all the information needed for VA to make an eligibility 
(Regular  determination for persons who served on active duty of the a regular 
Military)  component of the Armed Forces.  The regular Armed Forces include active 
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard.  
 
  VA will accept legible copies of the DD214 Form. 
  Veterans separated after October 1, 1979, should furnish Member 
Copy 2, 4, 8, or any copy of a DD214 Form that includes the COS and 
the narrative reason for separation.  Veterans separated from military 
service after January 1, 1950, should have received  
DD214 Form. Veterans separated from active duty before January 1, 
1950, received documentation other than DD214 Form.  To be 
acceptable, it should indicate: 
 
a)  LOS, and 
b)  COS 
 
 
b. Veterans  Proof of service for Veterans on active duty is a Statement of Service (SOS) 
Still on Active  signed by, or by the direction of, the adjutant, personnel office, or commander 
Duty  of the unit or higher headquarters they are attached to. There is no one unique 
form used by the military for an SOS.  While an SOS is typically on military 
letterhead, it may also be electronic and both are acceptable.  The SOS must 
clearly show the: 
 
  Veteran’s full name, 
  social Security Number (SSN) or the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
  entry date on active duty, 
  duration of lost time, if any, and

c. Discharged  There is no one form used by the Reserves or National Guard that is similar to 
Reserve/  DD214 Form.  Selected Reserve describes a member or unit with the Ready 
Guard  Reserve designated by their respective services and approved by the Joint 
Members  Chiefs of Staff as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have 
priority over all other reserves. 
 
The National Guard is a unique element of the U.S. Military that serves both 
community and country.  Any state governor or the President of the United 
States can call on the Guard in a moments notice. 
 
Discharged members of the Army or Air National Guard may submit NGB 
Form 22, Report of Separation and Record of Service, and NGB Form 23B, 
Retirement Points Summary Statement, with the COS document.  Members of 
the Reserves should submit their points statement with COS. 
 
Typically, all members of the Reserves and/or Guard receive an annual 
retirement points summary which indicates the level and length of 
participation.  The applicant should submit the latest retirement point 
statement received, along with evidence of honorable service. 
 
VA will accept legible copies. 
 
d. Current  Individuals who are still members of the Reserves/National Guard must 
Reserve/  provide an SOS signed by, or by the direction of, the adjutant, personnel

Members  There is no one form used uniformly by the military for an SOS.  While an 
SOS is typically on military letterhead, some may be electronic and both are 
acceptable.  
  
The statement of service must clearly show the: 
 
  Veteran’s full name, 
  the SSN or the last 4 digits of the SSN, 
  entry date of the applicant’s Reserve/Guard duty, and 
  the unit must state the creditable (actually drilled) years served in the 
Reserves or the National Guard.

If Veterans cannot locate proof of service, they can request military documents 
either through the National Archives, http://www.ebenefits.va.gov/, or by 
completing SF- 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records. The completed 
form should be submitted to the appropriate address shown. It should not be 
sent to VA. 
 
In many cases, VA internal systems will have sufficient information to make 
the eligibility determination for those who served on active duty.  Lenders and 
Veterans should not delay requesting a COE pending receipt of requested 
military documents.

for Reserves  for loan guaranty benefits are eligible upon completion of 6 years of service 
and/or Guard  in an active or drilling status in the Reserves or Guard (unless released earlier 
specifically for a service-connected disability).  The applicant must have

service academies.  Lenders should contact one of the RLCs for assistance 
when one of these unique cases is encountered. 
 
   
i. Exceptions  There are numerous exceptions to the LOS requirements outlined in this 
to LOS  section.  For example, 1 day of service is sufficient for an individual who is 
discharged or released from service (regular active duty or Reserve/National 
Guard) due to a service-connected disability which would be listed on the 
discharge paperwork.  Because of the complexity and number of exceptions, 
this chapter does not attempt to cover all of them.  Because there are 
exceptions, lenders should not assume a Veteran is not eligible.  Instead, they 
should create an application and allow VA to make a formal determination of 
eligibility.

6. Restoration of Previously Used Entitlement 
   
a. Basic  Entitlement previously used in connection with a VA home loan may be 
Restoration  restored under certain circumstances.  Once restored, it can be used again for 
another VA loan.  Restoration of previously used entitlement is possible if: 
 
  property which secured the VA-guaranteed loan has been sold, and the 
loan has been paid in full; or 
  eligible Veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding 
balance on a VA loan and substitute his or her entitlement for the 
same amount originally used on the loan.  The assuming Veteran, 
substituting his/her entitlement, must also meet occupancy, income, 
and credit requirements.  This should be completed before requesting 
the Loan Guaranty Certificate in WebLGY, on the new loan. 
 
   
b. Special  In addition to the basic restoration criteria outlined above, a  
Restoration  Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on a prior VA loan 
Cases  under any of the following circumstances: 
 
  Regular “cash-out” refinance where the prior VA loan has been paid 
in full and the Veteran has made application for a refinance loan to be 
secured by the same property which secured the prior VA loan.  This 
includes refinancing situations, in which the prior loan will be paid off 
at closing from a VA refinancing loan on the same property, or 
  One –time restoration where the prior VA loan has been paid in full, 
but the Veteran has not disposed of the property securing the loan.  
The Veteran may obtain restoration of the entitlement used on the 
prior loan in order to purchase a different property, one time only.  
Once such restoration is used, the Veteran’s COE will indicate the 
one-time restoration.  The COE will also advise that any future 
restoration (purchase or cash-out refinance) will require disposal of all 
property or properties obtained with a VA loan. 
 
Example.  A Veteran used all his entitlement to purchase a home for 
$453,100 in a non-high cost county in Maryland.  Prior to job relocation to 
GA, he refinanced the loan to a non-VA loan.  The loan was paid in full; 
however, he still owned the property.  He now wants to purchase a home in 
GA and applies for a one-time restoration.  This is possible.  If the Veteran 
wants to use the benefit in the future for another purchase or regular “cash-
out” refinancing, both properties would have to be disposed of before 
entitlement can be restored.

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
• Subsection a has been updated to remove information on cooperative units. 
  
a. List of  The law authorizes VA to guarantee loans made to eligible veterans only for 
Eligible Loan  the following purposes: 
Purposes   
• To purchase or construct a residence, including a condominium unit to be 
owned and occupied by the veteran as a home: 
−  the loan may include simultaneous purchase of the land on which the 
residence is situated or will be situated, 
−  loans may also be guaranteed for the construction of a residence on land 
already owned by the veteran  (a portion of the loan may be used to 
refinance a purchase money mortgage or sales contract for the purchase of 
the land, subject to reasonable value requirements), and 
−  the residential property may not consist of more than four family units 
and one business unit except in the case of certain joint loans.  (See 
section 1 of chapter 7 for this exception.) 
• To refinance an existing VA-guaranteed or direct loan for the purpose of a 
lower interest rate. 
• To refinance an existing mortgage loan or other indebtedness secured by a 
lien of record on a residence owned and occupied by the veteran as a home. 
• To repair, alter, or improve a residence owned by the veteran and occupied 
as a home. 
• To simultaneously purchase and improve a home. 
• To improve a residence owned and occupied by the veteran as the veteran’s 
home through the installation of a solar heating system, a solar heating and 
cooling system, or a combined solar heating and cooling system, or through 
the application of a residential energy conservation measure.  These energy 
efficiency improvement loans can be made in conjunction with any type of 
VA purchase or refinancing loan. 
• To purchase a one-family residential unit in a condominium housing 
development approved by VA. 
• To purchase a farm residence to be owned and occupied by the veteran as a 
home.  If the loan includes the purchase of farmland, the farmland is 
appraised at its residential value only.  (See section 12 of chapter 11).

b. Ineligible  VA cannot guarantee loans made for ineligible loan purposes.  Examples of 
Loan Purposes  ineligible loan purposes include: 
 
• Purchase of unimproved land with the intent to improve it at some future 
date (that is, the land purchase is not in conjunction with a construction 
loan). 
• Purchase or construction of a dwelling for investment purposes. 
• Purchase or construction of a combined residential and business property, 
unless, 
−  the property is primarily for residential purposes, 
−  there is not more than one business unit, and 
−  the nonresidential area does not exceed 25 percent of the total floor area. 
• Purchase of more than one separate residential unit or lot unless the veteran 
will occupy one unit and there is evidence that: 
−  the residential units are unavailable separately, 
−  the residential units have a common owner, 
−  the residential units have been treated as one unit in the past, and 
−  the residential units are assessed as one unit, or 
−  partition is not practical, as when one unit serves the other(s) in some 
respect; for example, common approaches or driveways. 
 
c. Cash to  Cash to the veteran from loan proceeds is permissible only for certain types of 
Veteran  refinancing loans and under very limited circumstances, as follows: 
Generally Not   
an Eligible 
• For IRRRLs, see section 1 of chapter 6. 
Loan Purpose 
• For cash-out refinancing loans, see section 3 of chapter 6. 
 
For other types of refinancing loans and all purchase/acquisition loans, the 
veteran generally cannot receive cash from loan proceeds.  The only 
exception is the refund of items for which the veteran paid cash, which were 
subsequently included in the loan amount. 
 
Example:  Earnest money can be refunded to the veteran on a no-
downpayment loan.

a. Does VA  Unlike other home loan programs, there are no maximum dollar amounts

Loan Amounts?   
Limitations on VA loan size are primarily attributable to two factors: 
 
1.  Lenders who sell their VA loans in the secondary market must limit the 
size of those loans to the maximums prescribed by Government National 
Mortgage Association (GNMA) or whatever conduit they use to sell the 
loans. 
 
2.  VA limits the amount of the loan to the reasonable value of the property 
shown on the NOV plus the cost of energy efficiency improvements up to 
$6,000 plus the VA funding fee, with the following exceptions.

b.  Because VA loans can be for the full reasonable value of the property, no 
Downpayment  downpayment is required by VA except in the following circumstances: 
 
• If the purchase price exceeds the reasonable value of the property, a 
downpayment in the amount of the difference must be made in cash from 
the borrower’s own resources, and 
• VA requires a downpayment on all GPMs. 
 
If a veteran has less than full entitlement available, a lender may require a 
downpayment in order to make the veteran a loan that meets GNMA or other 
secondary market requirements.  The “rule of thumb” for GNMA is that the 
VA guaranty, or a combination of VA guaranty plus downpayment and/or 
equity, must cover at least 25 percent of the loan.

4.  Maximum Guaranty on VA Loans 
  
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to note that Public Law 112-154 extended the 
temporary guaranty increase from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 
2014.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.   
  
a. Maximum  Public Law 112-154, the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp 
Guaranty Table  Lejeune Families Act of 2012, signed August 6, 2012, extended the 
temporary increase in the maximum guaranty.  The increase expired 
December 31, 2011, but Public Law 112-154, extended it through December 
31, 2014.  The maximum guaranty varies depending on the location of the 
property.  While VA does not have a maximum loan amount, there are 
effective “loan limits” for high-cost counties.  The limits are derived by 
considering both the median home price for a county and the Freddie Mac 
conforming loan limit.  To aid lenders in determining the maximum guaranty 
in high-cost counties, VA has created a Loan Limit chart, with instructions.  
This will be updated yearly. 
 
• In general, maximum guaranty, assuming the veteran has full entitlement, is 
as shown in the table below.

5.  Occupancy 
 
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• Subsection c has been updated to note that Public Law 112-154, the 
Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 
2012, signed August 6, 2012, expands occupancy to include dependent 
children.   
• This section has been updated to correct hyperlinks and make minor 
grammatical edits.  
  
a. The Law on  The law requires a veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan to certify that he 
Occupancy  or she intends to personally occupy the property as his or her home.  As of the 
date of certification, the veteran must either 
 
• personally live in the property as his or her home, or 
• intend, upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the dwelling, to 
personally move into the property and use it as his or her home within a 
reasonable time. 
 
The above requirement applies to all types of VA-guaranteed loans except 
IRRRLs.  For IRRRLs, the veteran need only certify that he or she previously 
occupied the property as his or her home. 
 
Example:  A veteran living in a home purchased with a VA loan is transferred 
to a duty station overseas.  The veteran rents out the home.  He/she may 
refinance the VA loan with an IRRRL based on previous occupancy of the 
home. 
 
b. What is a  Occupancy within a “reasonable time" means within 60 days after the loan 
“Reasonable  closing.  More than 60 days may be considered reasonable if both of the 
Time?”  following conditions are met: 
 
• the veteran certifies that he or she will personally occupy the property as his 
or her home at a specific date after loan closing, and 
• there is a particular future event that will make it possible for the veteran to 
personally occupy the property as his or her home on a specific future date. 
 
Occupancy at a date beyond 12 months after loan closing generally cannot be 
considered reasonable by VA.

c. Occupancy  Occupancy (or intent to occupy) by the spouse or dependent child satisfies the

Spouse or  personally occupy the dwelling within a reasonable time.  In the case of a 
Dependent 
dependent child, the veteran’s attorney-in-fact or legal guardian of the 
Child 
dependent child must make the certification and sign VA Form 26-1820, 
Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement. 
 
Occupancy by the spouse may also satisfy the requirement if the veteran 
cannot personally occupy the dwelling within a reasonable time due to distant 
employment other than military service. In these specific cases, consult your 
Regional Loan Center (RLC) to determine if this type of occupancy meets 
VA requirements. 
 
Note:  The cost of maintaining separate living arrangements should be 
considered in underwriting the loan. 
 
For an IRRRL, a certification that the spouse or dependent child (or children) 
previously occupied the dwelling as a home will satisfy the requirement. 
 
 
d. Occupancy  Single or married servicemembers, while deployed from their permanent 
Requirements   duty station, are considered to be in a temporary duty status and able to 
for Deployed   meet the occupancy requirement.  This is true without regard to whether or 
Active Duty 
not a spouse will be available to occupy the property prior to the veteran’s 
Servicemembers  
return from deployment.  
  
e. Occupancy  If the veteran states that he or she will retire within 12 months and wants a 
After  loan to purchase a home in the retirement location: 
Retirement   
• Verify the veteran’s eligibility for retirement on the specified date. 
- Include a copy of the veteran’s application for retirement submitted to his 
or her employer. 
• Carefully consider the applicant’s income after retirement. 
- If retirement income alone is insufficient, obtain firm commitments from 
an employer that meet the usual stability of income requirements. 
 
Note:  Only retirement on a specific date within 12 months qualifies.  
Retirement “within the next few years” or “in the near future” is not 
sufficient.

Improvements 
 
The veteran must certify that he or she intends to occupy or reoccupy the 
property as a home upon completion of the substantial improvements or 
repairs. 
   
g. Intermittent  The veteran need not maintain a physical presence at the property on a daily 
Occupancy  basis.  However, occupancy “as the veteran’s home” implies that the home is 
located within reasonable proximity of the veteran’s place of employment.  If 
the veteran’s employment requires the veteran’s absence from home a 
substantial amount of time, the following two conditions must be met: 
 
• the veteran must have a history of continuous residence in the community, 
and 
• there must be no indication that the veteran has established, intends to 
establish, or may be required to establish, a principal residence elsewhere. 
 
Use of the property as a seasonal vacation home does not satisfy the

Application, at the time of loan application (prior approval loans only), and 
• VA Form 26-1820, Report and Certification of Loan Disbursement, at the 
time of loan closing (all loans).   
 
This satisfies the lender’s obligation to obtain the veteran’s occupancy 
certification. 
 
The lender may accept the occupancy certification at face value unless there 
is specific information indicating the veteran will not occupy the property as a 
home or does not intend to occupy within a reasonable time after loan closing. 
 
Where doubt exists, the test is whether a reasonable basis exists for 
concluding that the veteran can and will occupy the property as certified.  
Contact the appropriate VA office if the lender cannot resolve issues 
involving the veteran’s intent by applying this test.

• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Requirement  VA no longer prescribes interest rates for VA-guaranteed loans.  The interest 
rate is negotiated between the veteran-borrower and the lender to allow the 
veteran to obtain the best available rate. 
 
b. Changes to  The lender and borrower are expected to honor any lock-in or other 
the Agreed  agreements they have entered into which impact the interest rate on the loan.  
Upon Interest  VA does not object to changes in the agreed upon rate, as long as no 
Rate 
lender/borrower agreements are violated.  The following procedure applies in 
such cases.  
 
Any increase in the interest rate of more than one percent requires: 
 
• re-underwriting to ascertain the veteran’s continued ability to qualify for the 
loan, 
• documentation of the change, and 
• a new or corrected Uniform Residential Loan Application, (URLA) with 
any corrections initialed and dated by the borrower.

a. Requirement  Veterans may pay reasonable discount points on VA-guaranteed loans.  The 
amount of discount points is whatever the borrower and lender agree upon.  
Discount points can be based on the principal amount of the loan after adding 
the VA funding fee, if the funding fee will be paid from loan proceeds. 
 
b. When Can  Discount points may be rolled into the loan only in the case of refinancing 
Points be  loans, subject to the following limitations: 
Included in the   
Loan? 
Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans  
A maximum of two discount points can be rolled into the loan. 
 
If the borrower pays more than two points, the remainder must be paid in 
cash. 
 
Refinancing of Construction Loans, etc. 
Loans to refinance are: 
 
• a construction loan, 
• an installment land sales contract, or 
• a loan assumed by the veteran at an interest rate higher than that for the 
proposed refinancing loan   
 
Any reasonable amount of discount points may be rolled into the loan as long 
as the sum of the outstanding balance of the loan plus allowable closing costs 
and discount points does not exceed the VA reasonable value.  
 
Reference:  See the maximum loan limitations in section 3 of this chapter. 
 
Cash-out Refinancing Loans 
While discount points cannot specifically be included in the loan amount, the 
borrower can receive cash from loan proceeds, subject to maximum loan 
limits (See section 3 of this chapter).  The cash received by the borrower can 
be used for any purpose acceptable to the lender, including payment of 
reasonable discount points.

a. Maximum  • Amortized loans:  30 years and 32 days,  
Maturity  • Nonamortized loans: 5 years. 
 
In addition, every loan must be repayable within the estimated economic life

The period for repayment of a loan is measured from the date of the note or 
other evidence of indebtedness. 
 
b. Maturity  VA regulations provide that any amounts, which fall due beyond the 
Extending  maximum maturity automatically, fall due on the maximum maturity date.   
Beyond the   
Maximum 
Thus, if a lender inadvertently makes a loan that exceeds the maximum 
maturity, it may still be subject to guaranty.   
 
However, the regulations also limit the amount that can be collected as a final 
installment, such as, they prohibit excessive ballooning.  The holder of a loan 
that violates this provision may desire to correct the situation through means 
which are legally proper in the jurisdiction.

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Requirement  All VA loans must be amortized if the maturity date is beyond 5 years from 
the date of the loan.  Loans with terms less than 5 years are considered term 
loans and need not be amortized. 
 
Generally, for amortized VA loans: 
 
• payments must be approximately equal, 
• principal must be reduced at least once annually, and 
• the final installment must not exceed two times the average of the preceding 
installments. 
 
Exceptions to these requirements are made in the case of: 
 
• GPMs – See section 7 of chapter 7, 
• Growing Equity Mortgages (GEMs) – See section 8 of chapter 7, 
• alternative amortization plans prior approved by VA, and 
• construction loans. 
 
b. Alternative  Certain amortization plans which do not meet the requirements described in 
Amortization  subsection a above may be used if approved in advance by VA.  A lender may 
Plans   submit an amortization plan to VA for prior approval if the plan: 
 
• is generally recognized; that is, is used extensively by established lending 
institutions, but 
• does not meet the requirements of approximately equal periodic payments 
and a reduction in principal not less often than annually. 
 
Exception:  GPMs and GEMs.

Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits.   
  
a. Protection  VA guarantees a portion of the loan, identified on the VA Loan Guaranty 
Against Loss  Certificate (LGC) by percentage and dollar amounts.  If a loss ultimately 
occurs on the loan, VA will reimburse the loan holder for all or part of such 
loss: 
 
• limited by the stated percentage and dollar amount of the guaranty, 
• limited by any VA maximums for reasonable and customary foreclosure 
expenses, and 
• subject to the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
b. Lender  It is the lender’s responsibility to comply with all laws and regulations related 
Responsibility  to the VA Home Loan program, and thereby prevent VA’s denial or reduction 
of a payment on a future claim.  A lender can accomplish this by ensuring that 
its employees who perform work related to VA lending: 
 
• understand and comply with VA policies, procedures and regulations, and 
applicable law, and 
• direct questions to VA when issues arise that are not addressed in this 
handbook or other materials provided by VA. 
 
c. When is a  A loan is automatically guaranteed by VA upon closing (prior to issuance of 
Loan that was  the LGC) provided the loan was made by: 
Closed   
Automatically 
• a supervised or a nonsupervised lender with automatic authority, and 
Guaranteed? 
• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations.

d. When is a  A prior approval loan is also guaranteed by VA upon closing (prior to 
Prior Approval  issuance of the LGC) provided: 
Loan   
Guaranteed?  
• the closed loan matches the proposed loan upon which the Certificate of 
Commitment was based, and 
• the lender complied with applicable law and regulations. 
  
e. What is  Evidence of guaranty is VA Form 26-1899, Loan Guaranty Certificate, which 
Evidence of  is generated electronically via VA’s webLGY application.  The LGC 
Guaranty?  represents tangible proof to the lender that VA’s guaranty is given in good 
faith.  It is contingent upon: 
 
• the veteran, property and purpose of the loan being eligible, 
• no fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the lender, and 
• the lender’s compliance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
For example, VA may deny or reduce payment on a future claim based on the 
lender or holder’s noncompliance whether or not VA has issued evidence of 
guaranty on the loan. 
 
The LGC also has an audit indicator that, if noted Yes, lets the lender know 
the case has been identified for full review.  In these instances, the lender then 
needs to submit a complete loan origination package to the appropriate VA 
office for review.  Packages should be submitted within 15 days of the LGC 
being generated. 
 
f. Total Loss of  Willful fraud or material misrepresentation by the lender or holder, or by an 
Guaranty  agent of either, will relieve VA of liability for payment of any claim on the 
loan.  VA also has no liability in the case of: 
 
• forgery on the note, mortgage, loan application, or other loan documents, or 
• a Certificate of Eligibility or discharge papers that are counterfeited, 
falsified, or not issued by the Government. 
 
A holder of a VA loan who acquired the loan without notice or knowledge of 
fraud or material misrepresentation in procuring the guaranty will not be 
denied payment of any claim on the loan by reason of such fraud or material 
misrepresentation.

g. Partial Loss  A holder of a VA loan who fails to comply with applicable laws and 
of Guaranty  regulations may receive only partial payment of a claim if VA’s liability 
increases due to the holder’s noncompliance.  Material misrepresentation 
which is not willful has the same consequence.  
 
No claim will be paid on such loan until the amount of any increase in VA’s 
liability is known.  The burden of proof is on the holder to establish that VA’s 
increased liability is not due to the holder’s noncompliance or 
misrepresentation. 
 
Examples of noncompliance with applicable law and regulations which may 
lead to an increase in VA’s liability include: 
 
• failure to obtain and retain the required lien on property to secure the loan, 
• failure to include the power to substitute trustees, 
• failure to procure and maintain insurance coverage, 
• failure to advise VA as to default, 
• failure to provide notice of intention to begin foreclosure action, 
• failure to provide notice to VA in any suit or action, or notice of sale, 
• improper release, conveyance, substitution or exchange of security, 
• lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction, 
• failure to assure that escrowed/earmarked funds are expended in accordance 
with the agreement, and 
• failure to take into consideration limitations upon the quantum or quality of 
the estate or property.

in reported data, such as date of loan closing, before they have generated the 
LGC, they must access the VA FFPS system to make the correction.  This 
will then result in the correct closing date being shown when the LGC is 
obtained.

to contact the appropriate VA RLC for assistance.  An LGC with minor 
typographical errors that do not compromise accurate identification of the

1. General Underwriting Information    
   
Change Date  February 22, 2019  
•  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  VA Underwriting Standards require lenders to always utilize the following 
Underwriting  guidance when underwriting VA-guaranteed loans: 
Information     
Lenders are encouraged to make VA loans to all qualified Veterans who apply.  
VA’s underwriting standards are intended to provide guidelines for 
underwriters.  Decisions must be based on sound application of the standards, 
and underwriters are expected to use good judgment and flexibility in applying 
underwriting guidelines.  Not all possible circumstances are addressed 
therefore, underwriters must apply reasonable judgment and flexibility in 
administering this important Veterans’ benefit. 
 
b. Basic  By law, VA may only guarantee a loan when it is possible to determine that 
Requirements  the Veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, and has present or verified anticipated 
income that bears a proper relation to the anticipated terms of repayment.  
VA’s underwriting standards are incorporated into VA regulations at  
38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and explained in this chapter.  This chapter addresses the 
procedures for verifications and analysis involved in underwriting a  
VA-guaranteed loan.  In the event the lender fails to perform their 
responsibilities, VA may take administrative actions including removal of 
authority to underwrite and close VA loans.

c. Lender’s  Lenders are responsible for:  
Responsibilities   
•  developing all credit information, 
•  properly obtaining all required verifications and the credit report, 
•  ensuring the accuracy of all information on which the loan decision is 
based, 
•  complying with the law and regulations governing VA’s underwriting 
standards, and with VA’s underwriting policies, procedures, and 
guidelines, and 
•  certifying as to compliance with all of the above.

d. Lender’s  Digital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature as 
Procedures  defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 
commonly referred to as the E-sign Act. 
 
The procedures below address only the credit underwriting of the loan.   
Chapter 5 of this handbook provides all procedures that must be completed 
when making a VA loan.   
 
Step  Action 
1   Initiate the VA and Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System 
(CAIVRS) inquiries described in Topic 4, Subsection c of this  
chapter. 
2   Obtain all necessary verifications.   
 
The borrower’s authorization can be obtained separately for the 
lender’s required verifications, or on one blanket authorization form.  
  
The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) obtained from WebLGY 
provides verification of the amount of the Veteran’s available 
entitlement, verification of exempt/non-exempt from the VA Funding 
Fee, and the amount of VA monthly service connected disability 
compensation.  Order the COE before ordering the VA appraisal. 
 
The tri-merged credit report and verifications can be ordered by the 
lender or its agent or a party designated by the lender to perform that 
function.  However, these documents must always be delivered by the 
credit reporting agency or verifying party directly to the lender or its 
agent, and never to another party.  VA only permits the Veteran to 
pay for the credit report invoiced amount, not any additional costs 
that the lender may incur through other parties for obtaining the 
credit report.

2. Income – Required Documentation and Analysis
Change Date  September 26, 2019 
• Subsection k has been updated for clarification.
It is the underwriter’s objective to identify and verify income available to 
a.  meet: 
Underwriter’s 
Objectives 
• the mortgage payment,
• other shelter expenses,
• debts and obligations, and
• family living expenses.
b.Effective Income is considered effective when it is determined to be verifiable, stable 
Income and reliable, and anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future. Income 
analysis is not an exact science.  It requires the lender to underwrite each loan 
on a case-by-case basis, using good judgement and flexibility when warranted.
To determine whether income is stable and reliable, the probability of 
continued employment must be determined through examination of the: 
• borrower’s past employment record,
• borrower’s training, education, and qualifications for his or her current
position, and/or
• type of employment.
Only verified income can be considered in the repayment calculation.

c. Spousal  Verify and treat the income of a spouse who will be contractually obligated on 
Income  the loan the same as you would the income of a Veteran borrower that will be 
obligated on the loan.  However, to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act (ECOA), do not ask questions about the income of the 
borrower’s spouse unless the: 
 
•  spouse will be contractually liable, 
•  borrower is relying on the spouse’s income to qualify, 
•  borrower is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance 
payments from the spouse or former spouse, or 
•  borrower resides and/or the property is in a community property state.  
 
In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be 
requested and considered in the same manner as for the borrower, even if the 
spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan.  See Topic 5, subsection 
a, of this chapter for additional guidelines for community property states when 
considering a spouse’s debts and credit history. 
 
The non-purchasing spouse’s (NPS) credit history does not need to be 
considered; however, the NPS’ liabilities must be considered to determine the 
extent of the household liabilities. 
 
d. ECOA  Always inform the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) that they do not have 
Considerations  to divulge information on the receipt of child support, alimony, or separate 
maintenance.  However, for this income to be considered in the loan analysis, 
it must be divulged and verified. 
 
Income cannot be discounted because of sex, marital status, age, race, or other 
prohibited bases under ECOA.

e. Income from  Verify a minimum of 2 years of employment.  Generally, in the borrower’s 
Non-Military  current position, 2 years of employment is a positive indicator of continued 
Employment  employment. 
 
If the borrower has been employed by the present employer less than 2 years: 
 
•  verify prior employment, plus present employment covering a total of 
2 years, or 
•  provide an explanation of why 2 years of employment could not be 
verified, 
•  compare any different types of employment verifications obtained 
(such as Verification of Employment (VOE), paystub(s), W2s, and tax 
returns) for consistency, and  
•  clarify any substantial differences in the data that would have a bearing 
on the qualification of the borrower(s).  
 
Use of Employment Verification Services 
 
Lenders may use any employment verification service that provides the same 
information as the “full” verification generated through the “Work Number” 
for all applicants. Generally, this will include the following information: 
 
•  the current date, 
•  employer name and address, 
•  Veteran’s full legal name, social security number (complete or 
truncated) and job title, 
•  employment status (Active or Inactive), 
•  length of employment and start date, 
•  salary rate and pay frequency, 
•  average hours per pay period, 
•  summary of year to date information including base pay, overtime, 
commissions and bonuses, and

VA required an original VA Form 26-8497. The requirements for obtaining a 
paystub have not changed. Hence, the paystub may be an original or a copy 
certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original. 
 
The lender may not charge a fee to obtain the employment verification 
information. 
 
Verification with VA Standard Documentation 
 
Acceptable verification consists of VA Form 26-8497, Request for Verification 
of Employment (VOE) or any format which furnishes the same information as 
VA Form 26-8497, plus: 
 
•  paystub(s) covering the most recent 30-day period with year-to-date 
information, if the employer normally provides a pay stub(s) to the 
borrower. 
•  if the employer does not indicate the probability of continued 
employment on the VOE, the lender is not required to request anything 
additional on that subject. 
 
The VOE and paystub(s) must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for 
new construction) from the closing date. 
 
•  For loans closed automatically, the date of the VOE and pay stub(s) 
must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for 
new construction) from the closing date. 
•  For prior approval loans, the date of the VOE and paystub(s) must be 
within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 
days for new construction) from the closing date.

(c)  If borrower works out of a union, evidence of the union’s history with 
the borrower. 
 
Alternative Verification Documentation 
 
Alternative documentation may be submitted in place of a VOE if the lender 
concludes that the borrower’s income is stable, reliable, and anticipated to 
continue for the foreseeable future; that is, if the borrower’s income qualifies 
as effective income.  Two years of employment with the same employer is not 
required to reach this conclusion. 
 
Alternative documentation consists of:  
 
•  paystub(s) covering at least the most recent 30-day period with year-to 
date information, 
•  W-2 Forms for the most recent 2 years, and/or 
•  telephone verification of the borrower’s current employment.

Commissions  which provides the following: 
 
•  the actual amount of commissions paid year-to-date, 
•  the basis for payments (salary plus commission, straight commission, or 
draws against commission, or other), and  
•  when commissions are paid bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, 
semiannually, annually, or other.  
•  individual income tax returns, signed and dated, plus all applicable 
schedules for the previous 2 years (or additional periods if needed to 
demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record). 
 
Analyze Income Derived from Commissions  
 
Generally, income from commissions is considered stable when the borrower 
has obtained such income for at least 2 years. Employment for less than 2 years 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous 
related employment and/or specialized training. Employment of less than 1 
year can rarely qualify; however, in-depth development is required for a 
conclusion of stable income on less than 1 year cases. 
 
For a borrower who will qualify using commission income of less than 25 
percent of the total annual employment income, IRS Form 2106 expenses are 
not required to be deducted from income even if they are reported on IRS Form 
2106. Additionally, the expenses are not required to be added as a monthly 
liability for the borrower. 
 
For a borrower earning commission income that is 25 percent or more of 
annual employment income, IRS Form 2106 expenses must be deducted from 
gross commission income regardless of the length of time the borrower has 
filed the expenses with the IRS.

The financial statements must be sufficient for an underwriter to determine the 
necessary information for loan approval.  
 
Financial Statements, including a year-to-date Profit and Loss Statement and 
Balance Sheet must be completed after one-half of the tax-year has passed to 
verify current income and stability of the income.  
 
The lender may require an accountant or Certified Public Accountant-prepared 
financial statements if needed to make such a determination due to the nature 
of the business or the content of the financial statements.

Employment   
Income  Generally, income from self-employment is considered stable when the

borrower has obtained such income for at least 2 years. Less-than-2-years 
Guideline, 
cannot usually be considered stable unless the borrower has had previous 
continued

Determine whether the business can be expected to generate sufficient income 
for the borrower’s future needs. 
 
If the business shows a steady or significant decline in earnings over the 
period analyzed, the reasons for such decline must be analyzed to determine

If it is difficult to determine the probability of continued operation, obtain 
documentation on the viability and potential future earnings, and an 
explanation of the function and financial operations of the business from a 
qualified party. 
 
Deductions and Expenses Claimed on Tax Returns 
 
Depreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns and financial 
statements of the business may be included in effective income. 
 
Business or roll over losses must be considered from all tax returns. 
 
What is reported to the IRS on a joint return must be used when applying for a 
federally guaranteed loan. 
 
On a joint tax return, the loss must be deducted from the borrower’s income in 
both community and non-community property states. 
 
On a joint tax return, when a borrower and co-borrower have been faced with 
business losses, the Veteran/borrower and his/her spouse may want to consider 
both being on the loan in order to potentially qualify.  The credit of both 
borrowers will be considered.

k. Active  For active-duty military borrowers, a Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) is 
Military  required instead of a VOE.  The LES must be an original, electronic, or a copy 
Borrower’s  certified by the lender to be a true copy of the original.     
Income 
 
The LES must furnish the same information as a VOE and must be no more 
than 120 days old (180 days for new construction), from the date of closing. 
 
For loans closed automatically, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of 
the date the note is signed (180 days for new construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, the date of the LES must be within 120 days of the 
date the application is received by VA (180 days for new construction).  
 
In addition, identify servicemembers who are within 12 months of release 
from active duty or the end of their contract term. For an enlisted 
servicemember, find the date of expiration (ETS) of the borrower’s current 
contract for active service on the LES.  For National Guard or Reserve 
members, find the ETS of the borrower’s current contract on the LES.  Also, if 
a National Guard or Reserve member is currently serving on active duty, also 
identify the expiration date of the current active-duty tour.  If the date is within 
12 months of the projected date that the loan will close, the loan package must 
also include one of the following items, or combinations of items, to be 
acceptable: 
 
•  documentation that the servicemember has already re-enlisted or 
extended his/her period of active duty to a date beyond the 12-month 
period following the projected closing of the loan, or 
•  documentation that the servicemember has already re-enlisted or 
extended his/her period of active-duty service to a date beyond the  
12-month period following the projected closing of the loan, or 
•  verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or 
verification of military retirement income following the release from 
active-duty service, or 
•  verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment and/or 
verification of military retirement income following the release from

k. Active  •  a statement from the servicemember that he/she intends to re-enlist or 
Military  extend his/her period of active-duty service to a date beyond the 12-
Borrower’s 
month period, plus (1) a statement from the servicemember’s 
Income, 
commanding officer confirming that the servicemember is eligible to 
continued 
re-enlist or extend his/her active-duty service as indicated, and (2) the 
commanding officer has no reason to believe that such re-enlistment or 
extension of active-duty service will not be granted, or  
•  documentation of other unusual strong positive underwriting factors, 
such as a downpayment of at least 10 percent from the borrower’s own 
assets (not a gift), a minimum of 6 months PITI, in cash, after the 
downpayment from the borrower’s own assets (not a gift) or clear 
evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a non-military 
spouse’s income so high that only minimal income from the active-duty 
servicemember is needed to qualify.  
 
If an Officer has an ETS date listed as 888888 or 000000 on his or her LES, 
the above documentation is not required unless there is evidence that the 
Officer has resigned his or her commission.   
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates her ETS date listed on her 
LES is 171031 (October 31, 2017) and the projected date of closing is October 
1, 2017.  Therefore, one of the above items is needed to verify future income 
since her ETS date is less than 12 months from the projected date of closing. 
 
Example: A member of the Reserves has been called to Active Duty.  The 
ETS date on his LES indicates 181031 (October 31, 2018); however, his active 
duty orders indicate his active duty tour will not exceed the next 60 days.  
Therefore, since he will be leaving active duty before 12 months of the 
projected closing date, the active-duty income cannot be considered, and his 
civilian employment and drill duty will need to be considered. 
 
Example: An Active Duty Veteran’s LES indicates his ETS date is less than 1 
month from the anticipated date of closing, and he indicates he will be 
receiving military retirement and has accepted civilian employment.  Verify 
his future retirement income from the Department of Defense and verify future 
civilian employment with the Veteran’s new employer.

continued 
The lender may include verified allowances in effective income.  These 
allowances are not taxable income. The clothing allowance generally appears 
on the LES as an annual amount.  Convert the annual amount to a monthly 
amount for the Loan Analysis. 
 
Verification and Analysis of Other Military Allowances 
 
To consider a military allowance in the underwriting analysis, obtain 
verification of the type and amount of the military allowance, how long the 
borrower has received it and the continuance into the foreseeable future. 
 
Military allowances may be included in effective income only if such income 
can be expected to continue because of the nature of the borrower’s assigned 
duties.  Such allowances include, but are not limited to:  
 
•  proficiency pay, such as linguistic, parachute, scuba, flight or hazard 
pay, and  
•  overseas or combat pay (sea pay, submarine, etc.) 
 
All types of allowances above are subject to periodic review and/or testing of 
the recipient to ascertain whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if 
it can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be 
expected to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, 
should the income be added to base pay. Contact the borrower’s chain of 
command if there are questions regarding the continuance of the income. 
 
If the duration of the military allowance cannot be determined, this source of 
income may still be used to offset short term obligations of 6 to 24 months 
duration. 
 
Consult the IRS to determine if any allowances for pay are considered taxable 
income by the IRS, unlike housing, clothing, and subsistence allowances.

Income from Recently Activated Members of the Reserve or National 
Guard 
 
Lenders must consider if a borrower, whose income is being used to qualify 
for a loan, may have a change in income due to participation in a 
Reserves/National Guard unit subject to activation. 
 
If an activated Reserves/National Guard member applies for a loan, they must 
present orders indicating their current active duty tour is not to exceed 12 
months.   
 
Example: The borrower’s full-time civilian employment is $3,000 per month.  
The borrower’s current income from the Reserves due to activation is $3,500 
per month and orders are for 12 months.  Since the borrower’s full-time 
civilian employment is only $3,000 per month, the $3,000 should be used to 
qualify the borrower. 
 
There are not any clear-cut procedures that can be applied to all cases.  
Evaluate all aspects of each individual case, including credit history, 
accumulation of assets, overall employment history, and make the best 
decision for each loan regarding the use of income in qualifying for the loan.  
 
It is very important that loan files be carefully and thoroughly documented, 
including any reasons for using or not using Reserve/National Guard income 
in these situations. 
 
As a lender, the goal is to provide the Veteran their benefit without placing 
him/her in a financial hardship.

VA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be 
documented for the likelihood of continuance. 
 
VA disability income verification will be placed on the COE.  However, there 
are some instances where this income is not placed on the COE which may 
include if the Veteran: 
 
•  will be discharging within the next 6 months from the military and has 
completed a Physical Exam Board (PEB) or Medical Review Board 
(MEB) and will be filing for VA disability while still on active duty, 
•  has recently filed for VA disability and VA’s Compensation Service 
has not yet made a determination and would be entitled to receive VA 
disability benefits, 
•  would be entitled to receive VA disability benefits, but for the receipt 
of retired pay, 
•  has received VA disability benefits in the past, or 
•  is an unmarried surviving spouse of a Veteran who is eligible for or 
receiving qualifying Disability and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), or 
•  is in receipt of a VA nonservice connected pension, or  
•  has a VA-appointed Fiduciary to handle financial matters. 
 
If the Veteran falls under one of the above categories, perform the following: 
 
•  Submit by fax VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA Benefits, to the 
VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) where the subject property is located.  
VA will complete and return the form to the lender by return fax.

automatic procedure, until the lender obtains the completed form from VA 
when the Veteran or surviving spouse is under one of the above categories in 
subsection m of this topic. The lender must maintain the completed form with 
the loan package. 
 
If the form indicates that the borrower receives a non service-connected 
pension or has a VA Fiduciary, the loan cannot be closed automatically.  The 
loan must be uploaded in WebLGY for prior approval.  See Chapter 5 of this 
handbook for the necessary documentation that must be submitted to VA.   
 
VA must review, underwrite, and issue a Certificate of Commitment before 
the loan can close.  See Chapter 5 of this handbook for prior approval 
procedures. 
         
VA’s Pension Service may also have to review and/or approve the application 
in addition to Loan Production.  The VA RLC will coordinate with the Pension 
Service upon receipt of the underwriting package.

continued  income, or insufficient retirement income, to support the loan obligation.  If 
the duties the borrower performed in the military are similar or directly related 
to the duties of the present position, use this as one indicator that the 
employment is likely to continue. 
 
Most cases fall somewhere between these extremes.  Fully develop the facts of 
each case to make a determination.  The guidelines under Self-Employment 
Income in Topic 2, subsection j of this chapter provide guidance for a recently

likelihood of continuance. 
 
Verification of Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Home 
 
Obtain a copy of the rental agreement for the property, if any. 
 
Analysis using Rental Offset of the Property Occupied Prior to the New 
Loan 
 
Use the prospective rental income only to offset the mortgage payment on the 
rental property, and only if there is not an indication that the property will be 
difficult to rent. This rental income may not be included in effective income. 
 
Obtain a working knowledge of the local rental market.  If there is not a lease 
on the property, but the local rental market is very strong, the lender may still 
consider the prospective rental income for offset purposes.  Provide a 
justification on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
       
Reserves are not needed to offset the mortgage payment on the property the 
Veteran occupies prior to the new loan. 
 
Example: The Veteran’s current home has a VA mortgage with a monthly 
PITI payment of $1,000.  Bonus entitlement is being used to purchase a new 
primary residence and the Veteran will rent the previous home for $1,200 
monthly upon closing of the new home.  The payment of $1,200 can be used 
to offset the existing mortgage payment, if all the above conditions are met.  
The additional rent received in excess of the mortgage payment cannot be used 
as effective income. 
 
Verification of Rental Property Income 
 
Obtain the following: 
 
•  documentation of cash reserves totaling at least 3 months mortgage 
payments (PITI), and 
•  individual income tax returns, signed and dated or lender obtained tax 
transcripts, plus all applicable schedules for the previous 2 years, 
which show rental income generated by the property.

If there is not a lien on the property, 3 months reserves to cover expenses such

Equity in the property cannot be used as reserves.  
 
Cash proceeds from a VA refinance cannot be counted as the required PITI on 
a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the borrower’s account before 
the new VA loan closes. 
 
Gift funds cannot be used to meet reserve requirements. 
 
Analysis of Rental Property Income 
 
Each property(ies) must have a 2-year rental history itemized on the 
borrower’s tax return. 
 
Property depreciation claimed as a deduction on the tax returns may be 
included in effective income.  
 
If after adding depreciation to the negative rental income, the borrower still 
has rental loss, the negative income should be deducted from the overall 
income as it reduces the borrower’s income. 
 
If rental income will not, or cannot be used, then the full mortgage payment 
should be considered and reserves do not need to be considered.

and Freddie Mac Maximum Loan Limits for Mortgages, located at 
https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads. 
 
Verify cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI), and 
documentation of the borrower’s prior experience managing rental units and/or 
use of a property management company to oversee the property. 
 
Analysis of Multi-Unit Property Securing the VA loan (Veteran will 
occupy one unit as his/her residence) 
 
Include the prospective rental income in effective income only if: 
 
•  the borrower has a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and 
•  cash reserves totaling at least 6 months mortgage payments (PITI). 
 
If each unit is separate and not under one mortgage, 6 months PITI must be 
verified for each separate unit. 
 
Equity in the property cannot be used as reserves to meet PITI requirements.  
This must be the borrower’s own funds, not a gift. 
 
Cash proceeds from a VA regular “Cash-Out” refinance cannot be counted as 
the required PITI on a rental property.  The reserve funds must be in the 
borrower’s account before the new VA loan closes. 
 
The amount of rental income to include in effective income is based on 75 
percent of the amount indicated on the lease or rental agreement unless a 
greater percentage can be documented (existing property). 
 
The amount of rental income to include in effective income is based on 75 
percent of the amount indicated on the appraiser’s opinion of the property’s 
fair monthly rental (proposed construction).

reasonable likelihood of continued success due to the strength of the local 
market.  Provide a justification on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
PITI reserves are not necessary to consider the income, and all the income may

q. Automobile  Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related 
or Similar  to a borrower’s employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset 
Allowances  a corresponding car payment.  However, if the borrower reports an allowance 
as part of monthly qualifying income, it must be determined if the automobile 
expense reported on IRS Form 2106 should be deducted from income or 
treated as a liability. 
 
If the reported expense is less than the automobile allowance, the amount can 
be treated as income and added to borrower’s monthly income.  
 
If the reported expense exceeds the automobile allowance, the amount must be 
deducted from income as a net calculation in Section D on VA Form 26-6393, 
Loan Analysis. 
 
Likewise, any other similar type of allowance received by the borrower should 
be considered with regards to the tax returns for determination of an offset of 
the corresponding obligation, as income, or as an expense.

•  disability income, 
•  dividends from stocks or other, 
•  interest from bonds, savings accounts, or others, 
•  royalties, 
•  notes receivable, and

VA disability income is considered a benefit and does not need to be 
documented for the likelihood of continuance. A COE will generally have the 
amount of VA disability income listed, however, see Topic 2, subsection m of 
this chapter for exceptions. 
 
A VA award letter or bank statement may also verify the current monthly 
amount received. 
 
The lender may include verified income from public assistance programs in 
effective income if evidence indicates it will likely continue for 3 years or 
more. 
 
The lender may include workers’ compensation income that will continue for 
at least 3 years from the anticipated closing date if the borrower chooses to 
reveal it.  
 
The lender may include verified income received specifically for the care of 
any foster child(ren), only to balance the expenses of caring for the foster 
child(ren) against any increased residual requirements.

r. Other Types  Example: The borrower(s) receive a stipend paid by the county or State for 
of Income,  two foster children living in the residence.  Instead of considering a family size 
continued  of four, a family size of two should be used to determine the residual income 
requirement. 
Do not include temporary income items such as VA educational allowances

Exception: If unemployment compensation is a regular part of a borrower’s 
income due to the nature of his/her employment (for example, seasonal work), 
it may be included. 
 
A borrower in receipt of VA Pension or Disability benefits with Aid and 
Attendance should be discussed with the VA Pension Service, VA 
Compensation Service, or the VA Hospital where the property is located, to 
determine if the income is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.   
 
If a borrower has a contract for employment in a foreign country (whether or 
not the employer is a US company or corporation), the income can be used if it 
is verified, stable, and reliable.  While some contracts are renewed yearly, 
consider the borrower’s past employment history and the likelihood of the 
contract being extended.   
 
Income that is paid by a foreign employer or government in foreign currency 
should be converted to US dollars.

a. Income Tax  Determine the appropriate deductions for Federal income tax and Social 
and Social  Security using the “Employer’s Tax Guide”, Circular E, issued by the Internal 
Security  Revenue Service (IRS).   
Deductions   
Determine the appropriate deductions for state and local taxes using similar 
materials provided by the states.   
 
The income tax should be based upon the borrower’s residence and what is 
documented in the guide to the IRS, and not solely the amount claimed on the 
paystub. 
 
An active-duty servicemember’s LES may have a different state tax deduction 
than the state where the active-duty servicemember will be purchasing a 
residence or refinancing.  Select the state listed on the LES for the state taxes 
to be considered in state tax deductions. 
 
The lender may consider the borrower’s potential tax benefits from obtaining 
the loan (for example, mortgage interest deduction) in the analysis. To do so: 
 
•  determine what the borrower’s withholding allowance will be, using 
the instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W-4, Employee’s 
Withholding Allowance Certificate, and 
•  apply that withholding number when calculating Federal and state 
income tax deductions on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, then 
•  document the change in deductions in Item 47, Remarks, on VA Form 
26-6393, Loan Analysis.

b. Income Tax  MCCs issued by state and local governments may qualify a borrower for a 
Credits from  Federal tax credit.  The Federal tax credit is based on a certain percentage of 
Mortgage  the borrower’s mortgage interest payment.  Lenders must provide a copy of 
Credit 
the MCC to VA with the loan package which indicates: 
Certificates 
 
(MCC) 
•  documentation verifying any expenses charged by the local 
government entity for the program which is listed on the Closing 
 
Disclosure Statement, and 
  the percentage to be used to calculate the tax credit, and if applicable, the 
amount of the indebtedness.  The certified indebtedness can be comprised of a 
  loan incurred by the borrower to acquire a principal residence or a qualified 
home improvement rehabilitation loan. 
 
 
There is an IRS annual limit on the tax credit equal to the lesser of the 
 
borrower’s maximum tax liability or $2,000.  Calculate the tax credit by 
applying the specified percentage to the interest paid on the certified 
 
indebtedness.  Then apply the annual limit. 
    
Example: The MCC shows a 30 percent rate and $100,000 certified 
  indebtedness.  The borrower will pay approximately $8,000 in annual 
mortgage interest.  The borrower’s estimated total Federal income tax liability 
 
is $9,000.  Calculate the tax credit as follows: 
 
Step  Procedure 
1  30 percent of $8,000 = $2,400 
2  Apply the IRS annual $2,000 limit 
3  The tax credit will be $2,000 
This allows use of $167 (one-twelfth of $2,000) as income to qualify the 
borrower. 
 
If the mortgage on which the borrower pays interest is greater than the amount 
of certified indebtedness, limit the interest used in the tax credit calculation to 
that portion attributable to the certified indebtedness. 
 
Since these programs are offered by state and local government(s), pre-
approval by VA is not required for the borrower to participate in the program.  
The lender is responsible to determine all eligibility requirements are met by 
the borrower to participate in the program.

Change Date  February 22, 2019  
  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
   
 
 
a. Assets and 
The borrower(s) must have sufficient cash assets to cover: 
Amount of 
 
Cash Required 
•  any closing costs, pre-paids, or discount points which are the 
for Closing 
borrower’s responsibility and are not financed into the loan, and 
•  the difference between the sales price and the loan amount, if the sales 
price exceeds the reasonable value established by VA (i.e. negative 
equity).   
 
VA does not require the borrower(s) to have additional cash to cover a certain 
number of mortgage payments, unplanned expenses or other contingencies on 
the residence, or refinance of the Veteran’s residence.   
 
However, the borrower’s ability to accumulate liquid assets and the current 
availability of liquid assets for unplanned expenses should be considered in the 
overall credit analysis. 
 
Reserves are required for borrowers using rental income to qualify.  See Topic 
2, subsection n of this chapter for more information.   
 
A rental offset does not require additional assets to cover PITI.  See Topic 2, 
subsection n of this chapter for more information.   
 
The assets securing a loan(s) against deposited funds (signature loans, cash 
value life insurance policies, 401(k) loans, other) may not be included as an 
asset on the VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis.  See Topic 5 of this chapter for 
more information.

b. Verification  Verify all liquid assets owned by the borrower(s) to the extent they are needed 
of Assets and  to close the loan.  In addition, verify any liquid assets that may have a bearing 
Cash to Close  on the overall credit analysis (significant assets). Use VA Form 26-8497a, 
Requirements 
Request for Verification of Deposit, or electronic, or certified copies of the 
borrower’s last two bank statements. 
 
Verifications must be no more 120 days old (180 days for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans, this means the date of the deposit verification 
is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the deposit verification is 
within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for 
new construction). 
 
c. Pending Sale  In some cases, the determination that the income and/or assets of borrowers 
of Real Estate  are needed to qualify for the loan depends upon the sale of presently the 
borrower’s owned real property.   
 
The sale proceeds may be necessary to: 
 
•  clear the outstanding mortgage(s) against the property, 
•  pay outstanding consumer obligations,  
•  make a downpayment or pay closing costs on the VA loan, and/or 
•  restore previously used VA entitlement.  
 
Evidence the sale has been completed should be included in the closing 
package to verify proceeds from the sale.    
 
As an alternative, the Veteran may sell the property with the buyer assuming 
the outstanding mortgage obligation.  See Chapter 6 of this handbook for 
assumptions (Release of Liability) with a Substitution of Entitlement to restore 
previously used entitlement. 
 
See Chapter 5 of this handbook for prior approval loans, which depend upon 
the sale of property for the borrower to qualify.   
 
See Chapter 5 of this handbook for all required loan closing documents.

d. Gift Funds  A gift can be provided by a donor that does not have any affiliation with the 
builder, developer, real estate agent, or any other interested party to the 
transaction.  A gift letter must: 
 
•  specify the dollar amount of the gift, 
•  include the donor’s statement that no repayment is expected, and 
•  indicate the donor’s name, address, telephone number, and relationship 
to the borrower. 
 
The lender must verify that sufficient funds to cover the gift have been 
transferred to the borrower’s account, or will be documented as received by 
the closing agent at the time of closing.  
 
Acceptable documentation includes the following: 
 
•  evidence of the borrower’s deposit, 
•  a copy of the donor’s funds by check/electronic transfer to the closing 
agent, or  
•  the CD showing receipt of the donor’s funds.

5. Debts and Obligations 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019  
  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
 
 
a. Verification 
All debts and obligations of the borrowers’ must be verified and rated. Obtain 
Requirements 
a credit report with all information for all credit bureaus.   See Topic 7, 
for Debts and 
Obligations  subsection a of this chapter for details on the type of credit report required.  
For obligations not included on the credit report which are revealed on the 
application or through other means, the lender must obtain a verification of 
payment history showing the obligation or other written verification directly 
from the creditor, including the payment amount and outstanding balance.  
The lender must also separately verify accounts listed as “will rate by mail 
only” or “need written authorization.” 
 
When a pay stub(s) or LES indicates an allotment, the lender must investigate 
the nature of the allotment to determine whether the allotment is related to a 
debt or other obligation(s).  Examples may include 401K obligation or 
repayment, child care, child support, or other.  
 
For obligations that have not been rated on the credit report or elsewhere, 
obtain the verification and rating directly from the creditor.  Include a written 
explanation for any obligation that is not rated. 
 
Resolve all discrepancies prior to closing.  If the credit report, deposit 
verification, bank statement, or pay stub(s) reveals any debts or obligations 
which were not divulged by the borrowers): 
 
•  obtain clarification as to the status of such debts from the borrower(s), 
then 
•  verify any remaining discrepancies with the creditor. 
 
Credit reports and verifications must be no more than 120 days old (180 days 
for new construction).  
 
For automatically closed loans, this means the date of the credit report or 
verification is within 120 days of the date the note is signed (180 days for new 
construction).  
 
For prior approval loans, this means the date of the credit report or verification 
is within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA (180 days for 
new construction).

•  if the borrower(s) is relying on alimony, child support, or maintenance 
payments from the spouse (or former spouse), or 
•  in community property states. 
 
If either of these situations is applicable, the lender must: 
 
•  Obtain a credit report on the non-purchasing spouse in addition to the 
Veteran’s credit report. 
•  Consider the spouse’s credit history in reaching a determination.  A 
Veteran borrower with a satisfactory credit history may be considered a 
satisfactory risk even though the non-purchasing spouse’s credit may 
be unsatisfactory.  
•  Include the monthly payment of the non-purchasing spouse’s debts on 
the VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. For debts such as judgments and 
unpaid collection accounts, lenders should consider the Veteran’s 
capacity to address the debt(s).  
•  Develop the facts surrounding any unsatisfied judgments on the 
spouse’s credit report, such as where the judgment was filed and 
whether the parties were married to one another at the time, and secure 
a competent legal opinion whether the judgment may become a lien 
against the property. 
•  Exclude the monthly payment on the spouse’s debts from the loan 
analysis when a reliable source of income for the spouse is verified to 
reach such a conclusion which is voluntarily provided. 
•  Document VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, with an explanation of 
facts and determination when concluding credit worthiness of the 
Veteran or excluding obligations of the non-purchasing spouse.

b. Verification  The payment amount of any alimony and/or child support obligation of the 
of Alimony and  borrower must be verified. 
Child Support   
Obligations 
Do not request documentation of a borrower’s divorce unless it is necessary to 
verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the 
borrower.  If, however, in the routine course of processing the loan, the lender 
encounters direct evidence (such as, in the credit report) that a child support or 
alimony obligation exists, they should make any inquiries necessary to resolve 
discrepancies and obtain the appropriate verification. 
 
Spousal support may be treated as a reduction in income on VA Form 26-
6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
Child support payment is treated as a liability on VA Form 26-6393, Loan 
Analysis. 
 
c. Analysis of  Significant debts and obligations include: 
Debts and   
Obligations 
•  debts and obligations with a remaining term of 10 months or more; that 
is, long-term obligations, and 
•  accounts with a term of less than 10 months that require payments so 
large as to cause a severe impact on the family’s resources for any 
period of time. 
 
Example: Monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan or lease with a 
remaining balance of $1,500, even though it should be paid out in 5 months, 
would be considered significant.  The payment amount is so large as to cause a 
severe impact on the family’s resources during the first, most critical, months 
of the home loan. 
 
Determine whether debts and obligations which do not fit the description of 
“significant” should be given any weight in the analysis.  They may have an 
impact on the borrower’s ability to provide for family living expenses. 
                                                                                                  Continued on next page

purpose.  See Topic 4, subsection c of this chapter for necessary documents. 
 
f. Secondary  If the borrower(s) plans to obtain a second mortgage simultaneously with the 
Borrowing  VA-guaranteed loan, include the second mortgage payment as a significant 
debt.  From an underwriting standpoint, the Veteran must not be placed in a 
substantially worse position than if the entire amount borrowed had been 
guaranteed by VA.   See Chapter 9 of this handbook for VA limitations on 
secondary borrowing.

f. Secondary  If the borrower(s) provides written evidence that the student loan debt will be 
Borrowing,  deferred at least 12 months beyond the date of closing, a monthly payment 
continued  does not need to be considered. 
 
If a student loan is in repayment, or scheduled to begin within 12 months from 
the date of VA loan closing, the lender must consider the anticipated monthly 
obligation in the loan analysis and utilize the payment established by 
calculating each loan at a rate of five percent of the outstanding balance 
divided by 12 months. 
 
Example:  A borrower has a $25,000 student loan balance and you multiple it 
by 5%, which equals $1,250.  This amount ($1,250) is divided by 12 months to 
equal a monthly payment of $104.17.  
 
If the payment(s) reported on the credit report for each student loan(s) is 
greater than the threshold payment calculation above in a above, the lender 
must use the payment recorded on the credit report. 
   
If the payment(s) reported on the credit report is less than the threshold 
payment calculation above, in order to count the lower payment, the loan file 
must contain a statement from the student loan servicer that reflects the actual 
loan terms and payment information for each student loan(s). 
 
The statement(s) must be dated within 60 days of VA loan closing, and may be 
an electronic copy from the student loan servicer’s website or a printed 
statement provided by the student loan servicer. 
 
It is the lender’s discretion as to whether the credit report should be 
supplemented with this information.

c. What is the  CAIVRS is a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
Credit Alert  maintained computer information system which enables participating lenders 
Verification  to learn when a borrower has previously defaulted on a federally-assisted loan. 
Reporting 
More information can be found at:       
System 
http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/caivrs 
(CAIVRS)? 
 
The database includes default information from the Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Education, Department of Justice, HUD, Small Business 
Administration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and VA. 
   
The VA default information included in the database relates to: 
 
•  overpayments on education cases, 
•  overpayments on disability benefits income, and 
•  claims paid due to home loan foreclosures which resulted in a debt of 
the government (Generally type 2 VA loans). 
 
CAIVRS Procedures 
 
A CAIVRS inquiry must be performed for all borrowers and co-borrowers 
(Veteran or non-Veteran) on all VA loans, including IRRRLs. The one 
exception to this policy is that CAIVRS is not required for non-purchasing 
spouses in community property states. 
 
VA assigns a 10-digit VA lender identification number (ID) to each new 
lender, then automatically forwards the ID number to HUD with a request to 
grant the lender CAIVRS access.  The lender can begin accessing CAIVRS 
usually between 7 to 10 business days after receiving its VA ID number 
assignment. 
 
To register for CAIVRS access for first time users, please use the following 
link: https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/f57register.cfm. 
 
Please direct questions concerning problems encountered with accessing 
CAIVRS to caivrs_admin@hud.gov.  
 
If the borrower(s) is found to have a delinquent federal debt through CAIVRS, 
the validity and delinquency status of the debt should be verified by contacting 
the creditor agency using the contact phone number and case number reflected 
on the borrower’s CAIVRS report.

•  Suspend processing of the loan application to determine the reason for 
the non “A” number.  
•  Give full consideration to the CAIVRS information, and any 
subsequent clarifying information or documentation provided, in 
applying VA credit standards.  Any non “A” number received does not 
automatically disqualify a Veteran from using their home loan benefit; 
however, the lender must document and justify the approval. See Topic

•  If a previous VA loan is involved that resulted in a debt to the 
government (due to foreclosures, short sale, deed in lieu, or other), the 
borrower may contact the VA Debt Management Center at 1-800-827-
0648 or at dmc.ops@va.gov to make arrangements to repay the debt. 
 
Generally, only type 2 VA loans (fifth digit of the VA loan number) result in a 
debt to VA and are reported.  The Veteran’s entitlement cannot be restored 
until the debt to VA is paid in full.

paid in full.    
 
Each agency has their timeliness requirements before removing a non “A” 
CAVIRS finding.  This does not preclude the Veteran or borrower from 
receiving a VA loan if credit standards are met for VA loans.  See Topic 4.07b 
(13 and 14) of this Chapter for guidelines after a bankruptcy or foreclosure. 
 
Example:  A borrower suffered a loss on a FHA loan home loan 2 years ago.  
While HUD has not removed the CAIVRS finding as the 3-year waiting period 
has not passed for FHA, the lender is eligible to continue processing a VA 
loan without an “A” CAIVRS finding due to the borrower(s) meeting VA 
credit guidelines for foreclosures and documented in the loan file. 
 
CAIVRS information is only for the lender’s and borrower’s use in processing 
the loan application.  Only those persons having responsibility for screening 
borrowers and/or co-borrowers may use CAIVRS.  Any other use is 
unauthorized.

Example:  A borrower has delinquent taxes and payments have not been made 
for several years.  The establishment of a payment plan after the CAVIRS 
finding has been addressed may not be sufficient to show a satisfactory 
payment arrangement to repay the obligation. 
 
A borrower(s) cannot be considered a satisfactory credit risk if he or she has a 
judgment lien against his or her property for a debt owed to the Government 
until the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied.

Change Date  February 22, 2019  
  •  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
 
 
Credit Reports used in analyzing VA loans must be either Three-file Merged 
a. Credit 
Credit Reports (MCR), or Residential Mortgage Credit Reports (RMCR). 
Report 
 
Standards 
The credit report must be less than 120-days old (180 days for new 
construction).  For automatically closed loans and prior approval loans, the 
date of the credit report must be within 120 days of the date the note is signed 
(180 days for new construction). 
 
If an RMCR is used, the standards applicable to a RMCR include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
 
•  The report must be prepared by a reputable credit reporting agency. 
•  Each account with a balance must have been checked with the creditor 
within 90 days of the date of the credit report. 
 
For each debt listed, the report must provide the creditor’s name, date the 
account was opened, high credit, current status, required payment, unpaid 
balance, and payment history. 
 
The report must name at least two national repositories of credit records 
contacted for each location in which the borrower has resided during the most 
recent 2 years (separate repository inquiries are required for any co-borrowers 
with individual credit records). 
 
The report must include all available public records information that is not 
considered obsolete under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681) 
such as bankruptcies, judgments, law suits, foreclosures and tax liens. 
 
The RMCR must be an original or electronic report, with no erasures, 
whiteouts, or alterations. 
 
The report must contain a 24-month employment and residency history. 
 
VA may decline to accept a credit report which does not meet these standards. 
 
If possible, the cost of the credit report must be listed on the credit report.  If 
not possible, an itemized invoice identifying the borrower(s) is required to 
verify the cost on the Closing Disclosure Statement (CD) when charging the 
borrower for the credit report.

b. How to  The borrower’s past repayment practices on obligations is the best indicator of 
Analyze Credit  his or her willingness to repay future obligations.  Emphasis should be on the 
borrower’s overall payment patterns rather than isolated occurrences of 
unsatisfactory repayment.  Determine whether the borrower (and spouse, if 
applicable) is a satisfactory credit risk based on a careful analysis of the credit 
report and other credit data. 
 
VA does not have a minimum credit score requirement.    
 
Rent and Mortgage Payment History 
 
The borrower’s most recent 24-month rental history and any outstanding, 
assumed, or recently retired mortgages must be verified and rated.  Housing 
expense payment history is often a primary indicator of how motivated the 
borrower is to make timely mortgage payments in the future.   
 
Absence of Credit History 
 
For borrower(s) with no established credit history, base the determination on 
the borrower’s payment record on alternative or nontraditional credit directly 
from the borrower or creditor in which a payment history can be verified.  
Absence of a credit history is not generally considered an adverse factor.   
 
It may result when: 
 
•  borrower(s) has not yet developed a credit history,  
•  borrower(s) has routinely used cash rather than credit, and/or 
•  borrower(s) has not used since some disruptive credit event such as 
bankruptcy or debt pro-ration through consumer credit counseling.

b. How to  Adverse Credit Data 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  In circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally 
considered to be re-established after the borrower(s), have made satisfactory 
payments for 12 months after the date the last derogatory credit item was 
satisfied.  If a credit report reveals numerous unpaid collections and/or 
accounts that are not being paid timely, including some which have been 
outstanding for many years, then once the borrower has satisfied the 
obligations, and then makes timely payments on subsequent obligations for at 
least 12 months, satisfactory credit is considered re-established.   
 
Collection Accounts 
 
Isolated collection accounts do not necessarily have to be paid off as a 
condition for loan approval.  A credit report may show numerous satisfactory 
accounts and one or two unpaid medical (or other) collections.  In such 
instances, while it would be preferable to have collections paid, it would not 
necessarily be a requirement for loan approval.   
 
However, collection accounts must be considered part of the borrower’s 
overall credit history and unpaid collection accounts should be considered 
open, recent credit.   
 
Borrowers with a history of collection accounts should have re-established 
satisfactory credit in order to be considered a satisfactory credit risk.   
 
While VA does not require that collection accounts be paid-off prior to closing 
if the borrower’s overall credit is acceptable, an underwriter must address the 
existence of the collection account(s) with an explanation on VA Form 26-
6393, Loan Analysis, for excluding the negative credit history they represent.    
 
If the collection account is listed on the credit report with a minimum 
payment, then the debt should be recognized at the minimum payment amount.

b. How to  Charged off Accounts 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  These accounts are typically collections in which the creditor is no longer 
pursuing collection of the account.  The underwriter must address the 
circumstances regarding the negative credit history when reviewing the overall 
credit of the borrower(s). 
 
Disputed Accounts 
 
Lenders may consider a Veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses 
regarding unpaid debts except when the debt has been reduced to judgment.   
 
The underwriter should document the reason(s) for not considering an account 
on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis. 
 
Judgments 
 
Account balances reduced to judgment by a court must either be paid in full or 
subject to a repayment plan with a history of timely payments.   
 
A history of timely payments would be generally considered as making 12 
payments to reestablish credit.   
 
However, in certain cases when a judgment has only been in place for a few 
months, an underwriter could justify on VA Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, a 
shorter repayment history if the documentation indicates the borrower 
immediately addressed the judgment after it was filed and began a repayment 
plan. 
 
Payoff of Unpaid or Untimely Debts 
 
For unpaid or debts that have not been paid timely, pay-off of these debts after 
the acceptability of a borrower's credit is questioned does not alter the 
unsatisfactory record of payment.  A period of making timely payments on 
subsequent obligations for at least 12 months, then satisfactory credit is 
considered re-established.

b. How to  Consumer Credit Counseling Plan 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  If a borrower(s) has prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer 
Credit Counseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk 
if they demonstrate 12 months’ satisfactory payments and the counseling 
agency approves the new credit. If a borrower(s) has good prior credit and are 
participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, such participation is to be 
considered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in determining 
creditworthiness.  Do not treat this as a negative credit item if the borrower 
entered the Consumer Credit Counseling plan before reaching the point of 
having bad credit. 
 
Bankruptcy 
 
The fact that a bankruptcy exists in a borrower (or spouse’s) credit history 
does not in itself disqualify the loan.  Develop complete information on the 
facts and circumstances of the bankruptcy.  Consider the reasons for the 
bankruptcy and the type of bankruptcy filing. 
 
Bankruptcy Filed Under the Straight Liquidation and Discharge 
Provisions of the Bankruptcy Law (Petition under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code): 
 
•  If the bankruptcy was discharged more than 2 years ago from the date 
of closing for purchases and refinances, it may be disregarded.   
•  If the bankruptcy was discharged within the last 1 to 2 years, it is 
probably not possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are 
met: 
 
Requirement  Explanation 
1  The borrower(s) had obtained consumer items on credit 
subsequent to the bankruptcy and has satisfactorily made 
the payments over a continued period. 
2  The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the 
control of the borrower or spouse such as unemployment, 
prolonged strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance, 
and so on, and the circumstances are verified.  Divorce is 
not generally viewed as beyond the control of the 
borrower and/or spouse.

continued   
If the bankruptcy was caused by failure of the business of a self-employed borrower, 
it may be possible to determine that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk if all 
four of the following are met: 
 
Requirement  Explanation 
1  The borrower obtained a permanent position after the 
business failed. 
2  There is not any derogatory credit information prior to the 
self-employment. 
3  There is not any derogatory credit information subsequent to 
the bankruptcy. 
4  Failure of the business was not due to the borrower’s 
misconduct. 
 
Bankruptcy Petition Under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code 
This type of filing indicates an effort to pay creditors.  Regular payments are made 
to a court-appointed trustee over a 2 to 3-year period or, in some cases, up to 5 
years, to pay off scaled down or entire debts. 
 
If the borrower(s) has finished making all payments satisfactorily, the lender may 
conclude that the borrower has re-established satisfactory credit. 
 
If the borrowers) has satisfactorily made at least 12 months’ worth of the payments 
and the Trustee or the Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit, the lender may 
give favorable consideration.

b. How to  Foreclosures 
Analyze Credit,   
continued  The fact that a home loan foreclosure (or deed-in-lieu or short sale in lieu of 
foreclosure) exists in a borrower(s) history does not in itself disqualify the loan.  
Develop complete information on the facts and circumstances of the 
foreclosure. 
 
You may disregard a foreclosure finalized more than 2 years from the date of 
closing. If the foreclosure was finalized within the last 1 to 2 years from the 
date of closing, it is probably not possible to determine that the borrower(s) is a 
satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are met: 
 
The borrower (s) has obtained consumer items on credit subsequent to the 
foreclosure and has satisfactorily made the payments over a continued period, 
and 
 
The foreclosure was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
borrower (s) such as unemployment; prolonged strikes, medical bills not 
covered by insurance, and so on, and the circumstances are verified.   
 
If a foreclosure, deed in lieu, or short sale process is in conjunction with a 
bankruptcy, use the latest date of either the discharge of the bankruptcy or 
transfer of title for the home to establish the beginning date of re-established 
credit.  If there is a significant delay in the transfer of title, the lender should 
contact the RLC of jurisdiction for guidance. 
 
Deed in lieu or short sale 
 
For a deed in lieu or short sale, develop complete information on the facts and 
circumstances in which the borrowers) voluntarily surrendered the property.  If 
the borrower’s payment history on the property was not affected before the 
short sale or deed in lieu and was voluntarily communicating with the servicer 
or holder, then a waiting period from the date transfer of the property may not 
be necessary. 
 
If the foreclosure, deed and lieu or short sale was on a VA-guaranteed loan, 
then a borrower may not have full entitlement available for the new VA loan.  
Ensure that the borrower’s COE reflects sufficient entitlement to meet any 
secondary marketing requirements of the lender.

VA has approved Freddie Mac’s Loan Prospector, Fannie Mae’s Desktop 
a. General AUS 
Underwriter, and VA approved proprietary lender AUS systems to use in 
Information 
connection with VA-guaranteed home loans.  These systems incorporate VA’s 
credit standards and processing requirements. 
 
Lenders may use certain reduced documentation requirements on cases 
processed with approved AUS.  The level of reduced documentation depends 
on the risk classification assigned.  The systems use different terminology such 
as Approve or Accept.  The tables in this section give a general description of 
documentation waivers.  Please note that the documentation requirements are 
the same for these cases as for non-AUS cases, except for any differences cited 
in the tables. 
 
The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely 
determine a risk classification.  It is still the lenders underwriter’s decision 
whether or not to approve the loan.   
 
Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor.  
The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider 
of these systems. 
 
It is imperative that the data entered into the automated underwriting system 
be accurately verified.  The data utilized by the system must be supported by 
source documentation obtained by the lender.  Inaccurate or unverified data 
will result in invalidation of the risk classification.  Under certain 
circumstances, it could also result in a finding of material misrepresentation, 
which could affect the validity of the guaranty.   
 
b.  Because the AUS will be making the determination that the loan satisfies 
Underwriter’s  credit and income requirements, cases receiving an “Accept” or “Approve” 
Certification  rating will not require the underwriter’s signature on VA Form 26-6393, Loan 
Analysis (items 49 through 53).  However, the file must still contain the 
Lender’s Certification referenced in Chapter 5 of the VA Lender’s Handbook.

e. Balance  Examples 
Available for   
Family  A Veteran has a family size of 3 purchasing a home in Arizona with a loan 
Support-      
amount of $400,000.  The residual figure will be $990. 
Item 43, 
 
continued 
A Veteran has a family size of 8 purchasing a home in Georgia with a loan 
amount of $150,000.  The residual figure will be $1,199 (family size of 5 
which is $1,039 adding $80 for each additional family member up to a family 
size of 7).  The eighth person will not be considered in the calculation. 
 
Special Instructions   
 
Count all members of the household (without regard to the nature of the 
relationship) when determining “family size,” including: 
 
•  A borrower’s spouse who is not joining in title or on the note, and 
•  Any other individuals who depend on the borrower for support.  
 
If a dependent is claimed on the Federal Tax Returns, then the dependent must 
be considered as a member of the household, to calculate residual income. 
 
Examples 
 
•  Children from a spouse’s prior marriage who are not the borrower’s 
legal dependents. 
•  A dependent parent.  
 
Exceptions for Considering All Members of the Household 
 
The lender may omit any individuals from “family size” who are fully 
supported from a source of verified income which, for whatever reason, is not 
included in effective income in the loan analysis.   
 
Examples 
 
•  a spouse not obligated on the title or on the note that has stable and 
reliable income sufficient to support his or her living expenses. 
•  a child for whom sufficient foster care payments or child support is 
received regularly, or 
•  a parent who has sufficient stable and reliable non-taxable income.

e. Balance  Reducing the Residual Income Figures 
Available for   
Family  Reduce the residual income figure (from the above tables) by five percent if: 
Support-      
 
Item 43, 
• the borrower(s) is an active duty or retired serviceperson, or 
continued 
• there is a clear indication that a borrower will receive the benefits resulting 
from use of military-based facilities located near the property.  Examples 
include Guard and Reserve military retirees, 100 percent disabled Veterans 
and their family members, or Medal of Honor recipients. 
 
f. Debt-to- VA’s debt-to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
Income Ratio,  expense, installment debts, and other debt) to gross monthly income.  The 
Item 44  following steps are required to determine the debt-to-income ratio: 
 
Step  Description 
1  Add: Items 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 +20 +40 = Debt 
2  Add:  Items 31 + 38* = Income 
3  Divide:  Debt * Income = Debt-to-Income Ratio 
4  Round:  To the nearest two digits 
 
The “Debt-to-Income Ratio” heading in Topic 10, subsection b of this chapter 
contains special procedures to apply if the ratio exceeds 41 percent. 
 
Only the borrower's actual income may be used to calculate the residual 
income.   
 
Care should be exercised to ensure that the income considered tax-exempt is 
likely to continue and remain untaxed.   
 
Tax-free income includes certain military allowances, child support payments, 
workers’ compensation benefits, disability retirement payments, and certain 
types of public assistance payments.   
                                                                                  Continued on next page

f. Debt-to- Verify that the income is indeed tax-free before “grossing up.”   
Income Ratio,   
Item 44,  Tax-free income may be “grossed up” for purposes of calculating the debt-to-
continued 
income ratio only. 
 
•  This is a tool that may be used to lower the debt ratio for borrowers 
who clearly qualify for the loan.   
•  “Grossing up” involves adjusting the income upward to a pre-tax or 
gross income amount which, after deducting state and Federal income 
taxes, equals the tax-exempt income.   
•  Use current IRS and state income tax withholding tables to determine 
an amount which can be prudently employed to adjust the borrower’s 
actual income. Use a figure of 125 percent of the borrower’s non-
taxable income when “grossing up.” 
•  Do not add non-taxable income to taxable income before “grossing 
up.” 
•  If “grossing up” is used, indicate such and provide the “grossed up” 
ratio of 125 percent in item 47, “Remarks.” The actual amounts of the 
borrower’s non-taxable income should not be adjusted in in line 38. 
 
g. Past Credit  Indicate whether the borrower (and spouse, if applicable) is a satisfactory or 
Record-       unsatisfactory credit risk based on a complete analysis of credit data.

  VA’s minimum residual incomes (balance available for family support) are a

Income 
Instead, consider residual income in conjunction with all other credit factors. 
 
However, an inadequate residual income alone can be a basis for disapproving 
a loan.   
 
If residual income is marginal, look to other indicators such as the borrower’s 
credit history, and in particular, whether and how the borrower has previously 
handled similar housing expense. 
 
Consider the ages of the borrower’s dependents in determining the adequacy 
of residual income. 
 
b. Debt-to  VA’s debt-to-income ratio is a ratio of total monthly debt payments (housing 
Income Ratio  expense, installment debts, and other obligations listed in section D of VA 
Form 26-6393, Loan Analysis, to gross monthly income.  It is a guide and, as 
an underwriting factor, it is secondary to the residual income.  It should not 
automatically trigger approval or rejection of a loan.  Instead, consider the 
ratio in conjunction with all other credit factors. 
 
A ratio greater than 41 percent requires close scrutiny unless: 
 
•  the ratio is greater than 41 percent unless it is larger due solely to the 
existence of tax-free income which should be noted in the loan file), 
the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's 
supervisor, or 
•  residual income exceeds the guideline by at least 20 percent. 
 
Loans closed automatically with a debt-to-income ratio greater than 41 
percent: 
 
•  Include a statement justifying the reasons for approval, signed by the 
underwriter’s supervisor, unless residual income exceeds the guideline 
by at least 20 percent. 
•  The statement must include the reason(s) for approving the loan and 
list the compensating factors justifying approval of the loan.

d.  Compensating factors may affect the loan decision.  These factors are 
Compensating  especially important when reviewing loans which are marginal with respect to 
Factors  residual income or debt-to-income ratio.  They cannot be used to compensate 
for unsatisfactory credit.   
 
Valid compensating factors should represent strengths rather than mere 
satisfaction of basic program requirements.  For example, the fact that a 
borrower has sufficient assets for closing purposes, or meets the residual 
income guideline, is not a compensating factor. 
 
Valid compensating factors should logically be able to compensate (to some 
extent) for the identified weakness in the loan.  For example, significant liquid 
assets may compensate for a residual income shortfall whereas long-term 
employment would not. 
 
Compensating factors include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
• excellent credit history, 
• conservative use of consumer credit, 
• minimal consumer debt, 
• long-term employment, 
• significant liquid assets, 
• sizable downpayment, 
• the existence of equity in refinancing loans, 
• little or no increase in shelter expense, 
• military benefits, 
• satisfactory homeownership experience, 
• high residual income, 
• low debt-to-income ratio, 
• tax credits for child care, and  
• tax benefits of home ownership

Previous and  higher shelter expenses than he or she currently pays.   
Proposed  Consider the: 
Shelter 
 
Expenses 
• ability of the borrower to accumulate liquid assets, and  
• amount of debts incurred while paying a less amount for shelter. 
 
If a borrower’s application shows little or no reserves and excessive 
obligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in 
shelter expenses can be absorbed.  
 
f. Home  As a result of releases of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, many 
Mortgage  lenders are increasingly concerned that they are taking all appropriate 
Disclosure Act  measures to assure access by minorities and lower income households to home 
(HMDA) 
mortgage loans.  VA believes that it is important for lenders to be aware of 
how effectively the VA Home Loan Program can assist them in meeting this 
goal. 
 
Compatibility of VA Program with HMDA 
 
The no down payment feature is, of course, a primary advantage for 
individuals with low-to-moderate incomes.  However, lenders should not 
overlook other aspects of the VA program that will help in underwriting loans 
for such borrowers.  VA Credit Standards are written as guidelines and are 
meant to be interpreted and used just that way, taking into consideration all of 
an individual loan borrower’s financial, employment and family 
circumstances.   
 
Purpose of HMDA 
 
VA encourages underwriters to find ways to approve loan applications which 
ought to be approved but may not appear approvable upon direct application of 
the credit standards.   
 
Underwriters are encouraged to give consideration to every possible 
appropriate factor in seeking a proper basis for approving loan applications for 
every qualified Veteran.

Change Date  April 1, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Order of  The procedures discussed in this topic must be initiated and may be completed 
Completion  in any feasible order, with the exception of the Certificate of Eligibility 
(COE), as long as they are all completed prior to loan closing.  The COE must 
be obtained prior to ordering an appraisal.  These procedures apply to both 
prior approval loans and loans closed automatically (except the procedure 
which specifically refers to prior approval loans). 
 
To avoid delays in closing, it is recommended that the lender take the 
following actions in the very early stages of loan processing: 
 
  obtain a COE (see subsection b of this chapter), 
  request an appraisal assignment in VA’s web-based loan guaranty 
system (WebLGY), (see Chapter 10 of this handbook for the steps to 
order an appraisal), 
  initiate the Credit Alert Verification Report System (CAIVRS) and, if 
applicable, a complete VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA Benefits, 
(see Topic 6, Chapter 4 of the Lender’s Handbook), 
  request a credit report and verifications (see Topic 7, Chapter 4 of this 
handbook). 
 
b.  How to  Verify the Veteran’s or surviving spouse’s eligibility for home loan benefits 
Obtain a  and amount of available entitlement by obtaining a COE in WebLGY.  It is 
Certificate of  highly suggested that lenders obtain a COE online through WebLGY for the 
Eligibility 
most efficient processing times.  Veterans may also apply online through 
eBenefits. A COE obtained by the borrower in eBenefits will be in WebLGY.  
This COE can be accessed by the lender using at least two of the requested 
data points in the system, for example the reference number and Veteran’s 
social security number.  An additional or updated COE does not need to be 
obtained or updated unless a change needs to be made to the COE.  Please 
examine and understand the conditions of the COE. Failure to comply with 
the COE conditions may result in an ineligible loan (see Chapter 2 of this 
handbook).

f. Requirements  Ensure every active duty Servicemember who applies for a loan is 
for Active Duty  counseled through the use of VA Form 26-0592, Counseling Checklist for 
Servicemembers  Military Homebuyers, as early as possible in the transaction. 
 
The active duty Veteran’s and lender’s signature on the form signifies 
counseling has been completed. 
 
Ensure the Veteran, eligible as an active duty member, is still on active duty 
at the time of closing if the COE indicates: “Valid unless discharged or 
released subsequent to date of this certificate.  A certification of continuous 
active duty as of the date of note is required.”  If the lender becomes aware 
that the applicant is no longer on active duty, the loan may not be closed 
unless VA re-establishes the Veteran’s eligibility as follows: 
 
  A Veteran released from active duty must have a DD214 Form 
(member copy 4) with time served, Character of Service Discharge, 
and reason for the discharge listed. It must be uploaded into 
WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
  A Veteran released from the National Guard or Reserves must have 
evidence of time served and an Honorable discharge. This must be 
uploaded into WebLGY for the issuance of a new COE. 
 
  If a COE was issued based upon active duty service and the Veteran 
has been separated, eligibility must be re-determined based upon 
their length of service and character of service.   
 
g.  Obtain a  Upload to WebLGY all prior approval loans for review (see Topic 4 of this

2. How to Submit Loan Documents to VA
 
 
Change Date  April 1, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  Where and  Generally, lenders only need to submit documents to VA when the loan 
When to  requires prior approval or VA requests copies of the origination package for a 
Submit  Full File Loan Review (FFLR).  Lenders must use WebLGY, accessed via the 
Documents 
Veterans Information Portal, to submit all requested documents.   
 
b.  VA Loan  A 12-digit VA Loan Identification Number (LIN) is assigned to each loan by 
Number  VA at the time the appraisal or Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan 
(IRRRL) is requested. Use this number electronically in VA systems or where 
requested on VA forms and other documents.  Submitting an incorrect VA 
loan number can delay processing of the guaranty. 
  
c.  Who Can  Under certain circumstances, VA requires specific parties to execute 
Sign  documents. For example: 
Documents for   
the Lender? 
  a VA-approved underwriter must approve or disapprove a loan for a 
non-supervised automatic lender, 
  an officer of the company must sign the Lender’s Loan Quality 
Certification. 
 
Where VA does not have a specific requirement, branch managers, 
employees, and agents of the lender or holder may execute VA forms in the 
name of, and on behalf of, the principals. 
  
d.  Use of  When submitting loan documents to VA, lenders may use electronic 
Electronic  documents.  Lenders must be able to provide VA’s audit team members with 
Documents  printed, digital, or on-line access to records.

3. Prior Approval Loan Procedures 
 
Change Date  April 1, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a.  Loans to be  Lenders without automatic authority are strongly encouraged to enter into a 
Submitted for  sponsor/agent relationship with a VA-approved automatic lender to expedite 
Prior Approval  VA loan processing and underwriting.  If a lender does not have a sponsor, 
then they must submit an application to VA for prior approval lending.  Those 
without sponsors or automatic authority must upload all loans into WebLGY 
for prior approval, except IRRRLs made to refinance loans that are not 
delinquent (see Chapter 1 of this handbook).  
 
Lenders must upload all prior approval documents into WebLGY, for RLC 
review (see Subsection c of this Topic).  A user’s guide for uploading prior 
approval loans is available online at 
http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/documents/docs/prior_approval_LP_le
nders.pdf. 
 
All lenders, whether or not they have automatic authority, must submit the 
following types of loans to VA for prior approval: 
 
  joint loans, except Veteran-Veteran as a married couple (see Chapter 7 
of this handbook) 
  loans to Veteran in receipt of VA nonservice-connected pension.  This 
is not the same as VA disability – income based (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
  loans to Veterans who have a VA Fiduciary (see Chapter 7 of this 
handbook) 
  IRRRLs made to refinance delinquent loans (See Chapter 6 of this 
handbook) 
  manufactured home loans (home is not titled as real-estate) 
  supplemental loans 
 
Note:  COEs may indicate to submit VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA 
Benefits.  The form is completed by the VA RLC of jurisdiction where the 
property is located, and will indicate whether the Veteran receives VA non-
service connected pension or has a VA Fiduciary.  For a list of all VA offices 
and their jurisdictions visit

However, the underwriter must first attempt to contact the VA RLC of 
 
jurisdiction of where the property is located to discuss the circumstances with a 
Loan Specialist.   
 
 
  While VA cannot make the final underwriting determination without reviewing

VA will review the documents submitted and complete the following: 
f. VA 
Processing of a   
Prior Approval    suspend processing and request additional information from the lender. 
Application    send a notice of denial to the lender and borrower, or  
  issue VA’s certificate of commitment to the lender, which is evidence 
 
of VA’s approval of the loan to close and willingness to guaranty the 
loan. 
 
Loans submitted on the prior approval basis have a 10-business day timeliness 
requirement by VA. 
The processing time may be extended for loans involving the receipt of VA 
pension income or a Veteran with a VA Fiduciary. Either the VA Pension or 
Fiduciary HUB may have, in addition to Loan Guaranty, to provide a review 
of the loan file. 
   
VA‘s certificate of commitment must be obtained prior to closing and is the 
g. Certificate of 
Commitment  lender’s evidence of VA’s willingness to guaranty the loan.  The lender is 
subsequently entitled to evidence of guaranty if the: 
   
  the closed loan is identical in all respects to that submitted to VA on 
the URLA and described on the certificate of commitment (or, if not 
identical, any required VA approval of changes was obtained prior to 
closing), and 
  the lender has complied with all applicable provisions of the law and 
loan guaranty regulations in making the loan.  Additionally, all 
conditions of the certificate of commitment must be met. 
 
If, at any time prior to closing, the lender or VA has reason to doubt the 
continued qualification of the loan, the lender will delay closing until all facts 
are determined and reviewed again by VA. 
 
VA may cancel a commitment if the validity period of the certificate of 
commitment has expired (after 180 days), and there is no reasonable 
expectation that the loan will be reported for guaranty.   
 
A commitment may be extended under certain circumstances.  Contact the 
VA office of jurisdiction of where the property is located for a review of the 
prior approval commitment.

a.  General  If you are not the loan servicer or holder of the current VA loan, please refer 
Information  the borrower or purchaser to the servicer or holder of the current VA loan for 
processing.  Assumptions can only be processed and closed by loan holders 
and services with VA automatic authority that are holding or servicing the 
current VA loan.   
 
Loan holders or servicers holding the loan without VA automatic authority 
that are holding or servicing the current VA loan, may submit a prior approval 
package to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is located. See 
Topic 1 of this chapter.  
 
A VA assumption is also considered a Release of Liability (ROL).  
 
Properties that are security for VA-guaranteed loans may be disposed or 
transferred even though the loans are not paid in full. Veterans who dispose or 
transfer their properties under these conditions remain liable to VA for any 
loss that may occur as a result of a future default and subsequent claim 
payment, unless the property is transferred to a creditworthy purchaser who 
agrees to assume the payment obligation.  The servicer initially determines the 
purchaser’s creditworthiness.

continued  must complete a Substitution of Entitlement (SOE) when the ROL is closed.  
The Veteran’s entitlement is not restored unless the Veteran purchaser, in 
addition to assuming the payment obligation, also agrees and is eligible to 
substitute their entitlement for the Veteran seller’s entitlement. It is important 
for the servicer as soon as possible in the assumption process to obtain COEs 
for both the Veteran assumer and Veteran seller to determine if there is 
sufficient entitlement in which to substitute. See chapter 3 of this handbook. 
 
Unless the ROL is an unrestricted transfer, a closing disclosure is required.  
 
An ROL or SOE does not affect the original issuance of the LGC. 
 
 
b.  Who Can  While procedures for processing requests for assumption approvals previously 
Process Loan  depended on the date of loan (commitment made on or after March 1, 1988), 
Assumptions?    the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI) regulations authorize 
loan holders or servicers with automatic authority that are holding or servicing 
the current VA loan to be transferred to determine creditworthiness on all 
assumption approval requests processed by their servicers. 
 
c.  Servicers  Servicers with automatic authority are authorized to process and determine 
with Automatic  creditworthiness on assumption approval requests on behalf of VA.  Servicers 
Authority  must follow VA underwriting guidelines (see chapter 4 of this handbook) 
when processing and determining creditworthiness on these cases. 
   
Servicers must notify VA electronically of authorized ownership transfers and 
approved ROLs in VALERI.  Additional information on the reporting process 
is available online at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/valeri.asp. 
 
An underwriting and closing package must be uploaded into WebLGY, for the 
existing VA loan number.

f.  Approval  To approve the transfer of ownership: 
Requirements   
  the loan must be current or will be brought current at the closing of 
the sales transaction, 
  the prospective purchaser of the property is creditworthy, as 
determined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and Chapter 4 of 
the Lender’s Handbook, and 
  the prospective purchaser has agreed to assume all of the loan 
obligations, including the obligation to indemnify VA if a claim is 
paid. 
 
A processing fee may be collected in advance, including a reasonable 
estimate for the cost of the credit report.  The maximum fee for processing a 
request for assumption approval and changing the loan records is the lesser 
of: 
 
  automatic authority – $300 plus the actual cost of a credit report; or 
  no automatic authority – $250 plus the actual cost of a credit report; 
or 
  any maximum prescribed by applicable state law. 
 
VA does not specifically regulate when the processing fee may be assessed.  
However, when the processing fee is collected prior to signing the sales 
contract, the portion of the fee attributable to changing the servicer’s records 
(usually $50) must be returned to the seller if the application is denied or the 
process is not completed.  Therefore, VA recommends that the processing 
charge accompany the complete package.

h.  Decision  Approvals: If the application for ownership transfer is approved, the servicer 
Notices  must notify the seller and include instructions for the assumption of liability 
by the purchaser, the amount of funding fee that must be paid, and 
documentation needed to complete the process. 
 
Disapprovals: If the application is disapproved, the seller and purchaser must

i.  VA Appeals,  VA’s special approval does not release any obligor from liability. VA may 
continued   determine that special approval of the assumption is in the best interest of the 
government if: 
 
  the seller agrees to remain secondarily liable on the loan following 
assumption, 
  the seller is unable to otherwise continue payments on the loan, and 
reasonable efforts have been made to find a creditworthy borrower 
for the property, or 
  if an obligor is released without proper approval, VA may be released 
from further liability on the guaranty. 
 
VA has 7 calendar days from receipt of the seller’s request to make this 
determination.   
 
If approved, the VA RLC will notify the servicer and seller that the 
assumption has been approved and that the seller will not be released from 
liability to VA; however, the property can be transferred to the purchaser(s). 
The servicer should close the assumption with 30 days of VA’s special 
approval. 
 
If disapproved, the VA RLC will notify the seller and lender that the 
assumption has not been approved, that the seller will not be released 
from liability, and the property cannot be transferred.

The holder or its authorized servicing agent will then execute the release 
portion of the form.  
 
In those states where recording the assumption and/or the release 
instrument is necessary, the Veteran may be asked to pay the recording 
fees. 
 
m.  Funding  At loan transfer, the purchaser is required to pay a funding fee to the 
Fee    servicer equal to one-half of one percent of the loan balance as of the date 
of transfer. 
 
See Chapter 8 of this handbook for information on other exemptions from 
the funding fee and how to verify exemption status. 
 
When the transfer is a result of an unrestricted transfer, a funding fee is 
not required.   
 
The fee must be paid to VA within 15 calendar days of the date of 
assumption using the VA Funding Fee Payment System – VA FFPS . 
 
The VA funding fee cannot be financed into the loan being assumed.  It 
must be paid in cash at the time of transfer.

without Prior  jurisdiction of where the property is located (in addition to the VALERI 
Approval  system) within 60 days after learning of a transfer that did not receive prior 
approval by the servicer or VA.  
 
The notice must advise VA whether the servicer intends to exercise the 
option to immediately refer the case to foreclosure or to give the transferor 
and transferee the opportunity to apply for “retroactive approval” of the 
assumption. 
 
Upon learning of an unapproved transfer, the servicer may decide to demand 
immediate payment of the one-half of one percent VA funding fee and 
request a copy of the instrument of transfer to determine the liability of the 
purchaser. 
 
Loans for which a commitment was made prior to March 1, 1988, are 
commonly known as freely assumable loans.  Owners have the right to sell 
the property securing these loans under any terms; servicers may not impose 
a restriction, charge, or fee that would limit or nullify this right.  A funding 
fee is not assessed on assumptions of loans where the commitment was made 
prior to March 1, 1988.

o.  Assumptions  Liability assumed.  The purchaser should be afforded an opportunity for

Approval,   
continued 
  the purchaser pays the funding fee, 
  the purchaser has assumed all of the seller’s obligations in the 
transfer deed, 
  the assumption language is legally binding, and  
  it appears that the purchaser intends to satisfy those obligations. 
 
When these conditions have been met, then the Veteran and transferee 
must specifically apply for an ROL under 38 U.S.C. 3713.  See 
subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the original Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect the guaranty on the loan. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for a 
Substitution of Entitlement to restore the Veteran seller’s entitlement 
(see subsection r of this topic). 
 
 Liability not assumed.  If prior approval of a transfer was not 
obtained and the title was transferred “subject to” the mortgage or 
deed of trust, then the purchaser usually has no liability on the loan 
and no liability for the funding fee. In this instance, the purchaser 
may have no incentive to maintain the payments.

continued  
 
It may still be advisable to extend the opportunity to apply for 
retroactive approval of the transfer, with the expectation that the 
purchaser will assume liability for repayment of the loan. 
 
The original mortgagor remains liable on the loan unless he or she is 
released from personal liability with a qualifying assumption.  The 
Veteran and transferee must specifically apply for an ROL under 38 
U.S.C. 3713.  See subsection a of this topic. 
 
An ROL does not restore the original Veteran’s VA home loan 
entitlement and does not affect the guaranty on the loan. The LGC 
remains in the original Veteran’s name. 
 
After the completion of an ROL, a Veteran purchaser can apply for an 
SOE to restore the Veteran seller’s entitlement. See subsection r of 
this topic. 
 
An exception applies when the loan was made by a state, territorial, 
or local governmental agency and the law requires acceleration of the 
maturity of the loan upon sale or transfer of the property to a person 
not eligible for assistance under the special program.  VA has 
approved due-on-sale clauses to allow Veterans to participate in these 
programs and take advantage of below-market interest rates and 
benefits.

Should a purchaser fail to cooperate in the retroactive approval 
process, a servicer has the option of accelerating the loan.   
 
When making this decision, the servicer should consider the 
implications of state law when delaying acceleration as compared to 
the prospect of accelerating a current loan that has the potential for 
future timely payments. 
 
Any decision must be reported to the VA RLC of jurisdiction of the 
property and in VALERI.

q.  Release of  The following requirements must be met: 
Liability   
Procedures for 
  the divorce is final and absolute and it is determined no 
Divorce, 
appeal will be taken, or 
continued 
  a signed separation agreement by all parties based on 
local laws and available documents with reasons why a 
separation agreement is used in lieu of a final decree of 
divorce, and  
  the entire estate encumbered for the VA-guaranteed 
loan has become vested in the name of the Veteran’s 
former  spouse, and 
  there is not any knowledge of any property settlement 
that would make the Veteran liable between the parties 
to pay the guaranteed loan. 
 
Some states require a specific amount of time between a legal 
separation and a divorce (up to one year).  With proper 
documentation, do not delay the request for an ROL, if the divorce is 
not final, but a legal separation agreement is in effect. 
 
In some instances, the ex-spouse may also be a Veteran; however, for 
VA purposes, only the applicant who used their entitlement to 
guaranty the loan is considered a Veteran.   
 
For example, John and Mary Doe are divorcing and both have 
obtained a COE; however, only John’s COE was used to guarantee 
the loan.  Since Mary’s COE was not used to guarantee the home, 
only John is considered the Veteran.  If Mary wishes to assume the 
loan, a credit qualifying package is required for an ROL and Mary 
can substitute her entitlement with the assumption. 
 
When the Veteran is awarded the property, the ex-spouse may seek an 
ROL.

Divorce, 
Spouse (NVS) ROL.  
continued 
 
The servicer will be provided a with an NVS letter indicating VA has 
released the non-Veteran spouse of liability. 
 
The servicer may only charge a fee of $50 for amending its records to 
reflect the change. 
 
 It is not necessary for the servicer to complete an ROL. 
 
For example, Mary and Jon Smith divorced after they purchased a 
home using Mary’s COE.  She obtains the home per the divorce 
decree.  Since she is the Veteran and will be retaining the property, 
she will contact the VA RLC of jurisdiction of where the property is 
located to process the NVS. 
   
r.  Substitution  A Veteran may allow an assumption/ROL of his or her VA-
of Entitlement  guaranteed loan with the expectation of being able to have his or her 
entitlement restored.  A restoration may be needed to obtain another 
VA-guaranteed loan in the future by restoring the previously used 
entitlement for full entitlement benefits.  Entitlement cannot be 
restored until VA makes a determination of eligibility for the Veteran 
assumer and Veteran seller and processes the SOE.  VA completes the 
SOE process after a servicer closes the assumption and issues an 
ROL.  Questions about an SOE should be directed to the VA RLC 
with jurisdiction where the property is located. 
 
It is important for the servicer to obtain a COE as soon as possible in 
the assumption process to determine if there is sufficient entitlement 
for the Veteran assumer to complete the SOE for the Veteran seller.  
Entitlement must be of equal amounts to substitute.  See Chapter 3 of 
this handbook for determination of home loan eligibility.

r.  Substitution  When a Veteran requests approval for a transfer of ownership, he or 
of Entitlement,  she may request to have entitlement restored for use on another VA 
continued   loan. For VA to approve such a request: 
 
  the assumption (ROL) must be completed and closed by the lender; 
  the purchaser must be an eligible Veteran who has sufficient 
entitlement to substitute for that of the original Veteran; 
  the purchaser must certify that the property securing the loan will be

Whenever two Veterans intend to follow the SOE process, the 
servicer should have the Veteran purchaser complete VA Form 26-
8106, Statement of Veteran Assuming GI Loan, (Substitution of 
entitlement).  It should be included in the closing package submitted 
to VA. 
 
A COE for each Veteran should accompany the credit package used 
to approve the ROL. 
 
It is important to verify the purchasing Veteran has sufficient 
entitlement, is willing to substitute their entitlement, and will meet 
occupancy requirements to substitute before the closing of the ROL to 
meet the requirements of an SOE.

are not subject to 38 U.S.C. 3714. 
 
These sale agreements do not require prior approval from the servicer

change in his or her address. 
 
Sales by installment contracts typically call for transfer of title after a

If the contract calls for title to transfer prior to payment in full of the

procedures previously discussed. 
 
Processing charges and VA funding fees will be applicable upon 
transfer. 
 
As one of the conditions of the contract, servicers should advise the 
borrower that the language stating an application for assumption 
approval will be made, and approval secured, prior to the completion 
of title transfer. 
 
The contract should address the options of both parties if the request 
for assumption approval is denied. 
 
Servicers are required to retain the supporting documentation for all 
transfers, assumptions, and releases of liability for at least 3 years 
from approval or denial.  
 
An assumption package should be submitted to the RLC of 
jurisdiction of where the property is located.

 This section has been changed to update hyperlinks and to make minor 
grammatical edits. 
  
a. What is an  An IRRRL is a VA-guaranteed loan made to refinance an existing VA-
IRRRL?  guaranteed loan, generally at a lower interest rate than the existing VA loan, 
and with lower principal and interest payments than the existing VA loan.    
 
Generally, no appraisal, credit information or underwriting is required on an 
IRRRL, and any lender may close an IRRRL automatically.   
 
Note: Exceptions and specific requirements are explained in the remainder of 
this section. 
  
b. Interest Rate  An IRRRL (which can be a fixed rate, hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage 
Decrease  (ARM) or traditional ARM) must bear a lower interest rate than the loan it is 
Requirement  refinancing unless the loan it is refinancing is an ARM. 
 
c. Payment  The principal and interest payment on an IRRRL must be less than the 
Decrease/  principal and interest payment on the loan being refinanced unless one of the 
Increase  following exceptions applies: 
Requirements 
 
 the IRRRL is refinancing an ARM, 
 term of the IRRRL is shorter than the term of the loan being refinanced, or 
 energy efficiency improvements are included in the IRRRL. 
 
A significant increase in the veteran’s monthly payment may occur with any 
of these three exceptions, especially if combined with one or more of the 
following: 
 
 financing of closing costs, 
 financing of up to two discount points,  
 financing of the funding fee, and/or 
 higher interest rate when an ARM is being refinanced.

c. Payment  If the monthly payment (PITI) increases by 20 percent or more, the lender 
Decrease/  must: 
Increase   
Requirements 
 determine that the veteran qualifies for the new payment from an 
(continued) 
underwriting standpoint; such as, determine whether the borrower can 
support the proposed shelter expense and other recurring monthly 
obligations in light of income established as stable and reliable, and  
 include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceeds the previous payment by 20 percent or more. 
 
d. Veteran’s  For all IRRRLs, the veteran must sign a statement acknowledging the effect 
Statement and  of the refinancing loan on the veteran’s loan payments and interest rate.  
Lender’s   
Certification 
The statement must show the interest rate and monthly payments for the new 
loan versus that for the old loan.  The statement must also indicate how long it 
would take to recoup ALL closing costs (both those included in the loan and 
those paid outside of closing).   
 
If the monthly payment (PITI) increases by 20 percent or more, the lender 
must include a certification that the veteran qualifies for the new monthly 
payment which exceeds the previous payment by 20 percent or more. 
 
Example:   
 
 Vet’s monthly payment decreases by $50.00. 
 Vet pays $5,000 in closing costs (includes all costs – closing costs, funding 
fee, discounts, etc). 
 Recoup closing costs in 100 months - $5,000 divided by $50.  
 
Note:  This would not be required in those limited cases where the payment is 
not decreasing (reduced term of loan, etc.). 
 
The veteran’s statement may be combined with the lender’s certification and 
should be on the lender’s own letterhead.  For a sample please go to:

e. What Closing  The following fees and charges may be included in an IRRRL: 
Costs can be   
Included in the   the VA funding fee, and 
Loan? 
 any allowable fees and charges discussed in section 2 of chapter 8; such as, 
all allowable closing costs, including the lender’s flat charge. 
 
However, There Is One Limitation 
While the borrower may pay any reasonable amount of discount points in 
cash, only up to two discount points can be included in the loan amount. 
 
Although VA does not require an appraisal or credit underwriting on 
IRRRLs, any customary and reasonable credit report or appraisal expense 
incurred by a lender to satisfy its lending requirements may be charged to the 
borrower and included in the loan. 
 
The lender may also set the interest rate on the new loan high enough to 
enable the lender to pay all closing costs, as long as the requirements for 
lower interest rate and payments (or one of the exceptions to those 
requirements) are met. 
 
For IRRRLs to refinance loans 30 days or more past due (which must be 
submitted for prior approval), the following can be included in the new loan: 
 
 late payments and late charges on the old loan, and 
 reasonable costs if legal action to terminate the old loan has commenced. 
 
f. When Can  An IRRRL cannot be used to take equity out of the property or pay off debts,

Closing? 
IRRRL.  Therefore, the general rule is that the borrower cannot receive cash 
proceeds from the loan.  If necessary, the refinancing loan amount must be 
rounded down to avoid payments of cash to the veteran. 
 
The one exception is reimbursement of the veteran for the cost of energy 
efficiency improvements up to $6,000 completed within the 90 days 
immediately preceding the date of loan closing.

Receive Cash at  7. 
Closing? 
 
(continued) 
In a limited number of situations, the borrower may receive cash at closing.  
Some examples of situations in which VA does not object to the borrower 
receiving cash are: 
 
 computational errors, 
 changes in final pay-off figures, 
 up-front fees paid for the appraisal and/or credit report that are later added 
into the loan, and 
 refund of the escrow balance on the old loan.  This often occurs when a 
party other than the present holder originates the loan. 
 
VA does not set a “ceiling” or a specific dollar limitation on cash refunds 
resulting from adjustments at closing.  However, if a situation involves a 
borrower receiving more than $500, consult VA as to its acceptability.  
Lenders and VA personnel should exercise common sense when assessing 
such situations and draw from basic program information to know the 
difference between an equity withdrawal and cash from unforeseen 
circumstances. 
 
g. Maximum  Always use VA Form 26-8923, IRRRL Worksheet, to calculate the maximum 
Loan  loan amount.  The maximum loan amount is the existing VA loan balances 
plus the following: 
 
 including any late payments* and late charges, plus  
 allowable fees and charges (includes up to two discount points), plus  
 the cost of any energy efficiency improvements, and 
 the VA funding fee. 
 
*Any IRRRL that includes delinquent payments in the loan amount must be 
submitted for prior approval, even when a lender has automatic authority.

g. Maximum  Note:  There is no maximum dollar amount for VA loans.  Since an IRRRL 
Loan  rolls the above items into the new loan, and VA guarantees at least 25 percent 
(continued)  of the loan amount (without regard to the veteran’s entitlement), the new loan 
amount may be more than the limits established by the secondary market.  It 
is the lender’s responsibility to ensure it has a marketable loan. 
  
h. Amount of  No additional charge is made to the veteran’s entitlement for an IRRRL; such 
Guaranty and  as, the amount of the veteran’s previously used and available entitlement 
Entitlement Use  remains the same before and after obtaining the IRRRL. 
 
The new IRRRL loan amount may be equal to, greater than, or less than, the 
original amount of the loan being refinanced.  This may impact the amount of 
guaranty on the new loan, but not the veteran’s use of entitlement.  
 
Example Of New Loan Amount More Than Old Loan  
The existing VA loan was originally made for $110,000 with a guaranty of 
$27,500, or 25 percent.  The new IRRRL is for $112,000.  The guaranty on 
the new loan is $28,000 or 25 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use 
remains at $27,500. 
 
Example Of New Loan Amount Less Than Old Loan 
The existing VA loan was originally made for $42,000 with a guaranty of 
$25,000, or almost 60 percent (the percentage applicable under former law).  
The new IRRRL is for $40,000.  The guaranty on the new loan is $20,000 or 
50 percent, but the veteran’s entitlement use remains at $25,000. 
 
Amount  How to calculate the amount of guaranty on an IRRRL 
IRRRLs  First, calculate the lesser of: 
up to   
$45,000   50 percent of the IRRRL loan amount, or 
 the amount of guaranty used on the VA loan being refinanced. 
 
The amount of guaranty is the greater of: 
 
 the above result, or 
 25 percent of the IRRRL loan amount.

k. Who Can an  Generally, the party(ies) obligated on the original loan must be the same on 
IRRRL be  the new loan (and the veteran must still own the property).   
Made to?   
The lender should contact VA regarding a proposed IRRRL involving a 
change in obligors unless the acceptability of the IRRRL is clear.  Sample 
cases are provided in the table in this subsection. 
 
Examples: 
 
In Case 7, the divorced spouse is keeping the home and wishes to refinance.  
The spouse cannot get an IRRRL unless the veteran agrees to be obligated on 
the new loan and commit his or her entitlement to the new loan.  A person 
without entitlement cannot get an IRRRL or any other type of VA loan. 
 
In Cases 8 through 10, the applicants cannot obtain an IRRRL because they 
do not include the veteran or a person who was the veteran’s spouse at the 
time the original loan was made, and who was obligated on the loan along 
with the veteran. 
 
In the case of the unmarried veteran obtaining the original loan (Case 8): 
 
 the marriage and death of the veteran occurred after the loan was made, and 
 the deceased veteran’s spouse is not obligated on the original loan.  Thus, 
an IRRRL is not possible. 
 
In the case of the veteran and spouse obligated on the original loan (Case 9): 
 
 the divorce, remarriage, then death of the veteran occurred after the loan 
was made and,  
the deceased veteran’s new spouse is not obligated on the original loan. 
Thus, an IRRRL is not possible.

1. Joint Loans 
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety  
 
a. What is a  “Joint loan” generally refers to a loan for which the: 
VA Joint   
Loan?   Veteran and other person(s) are liable, and 
 Veteran and the other obligor(s) own the security. 
 
 A joint loan is a loan made to the: 
 
 Veteran and one or more non-Veterans (not spouse),  
 Veteran and one or more Veterans (not spouse) who will not be using their 
entitlement, 
 Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, and both 
entitlement will be used; or 
 Veteran and one or more other Veterans (not spouse), all of who will use 
their entitlement. 
 
A loan involving a Veteran and his or her spouse will not be treated as a “joint 
loan” if the spouse is:  
 
 not a Veteran, or 
 a Veteran who will not be using his or her entitlement on the loan. 
 
A loan to a Veteran and fiancé who intend to marry prior to loan closing and 
take title as Veteran and spouse will be treated as a loan to a Veteran and 
spouse (conditioned upon their marriage), and not a joint loan.  
 
b. Regulations  The regulations in 38 C.F.R. 36.4307 address joint loans. 
 
c.  For purposes of applying the principles explained in this section, this term will 
Terminology  also be used to represent any other type of joint loan involving at least one 
Used in This  Veteran using his or her entitlement, and at least one other person not using 
Section    entitlement (can be a Veteran or a non-Veteran, but not a spouse). 
 
                                                                                           Continued on next page

c.  Examples  
Terminology   
Used in This    Three Veterans using entitlement and one non-Veteran 
Section,    One Veteran using entitlement and four non-Veterans 
continued    Two Veterans using entitlement and two Veterans not using                         
entitlement  
 
Two Veterans Joint Loan: Commonly meaning a loan involving two Veterans  
who are not married to each other and both are using their entitlement.  
 
For purposes of applying the principles explained in this section, this term will 
also be used to represent any other type of joint loan involving only Veterans, 
each of whom uses his or her entitlement.  
 
This may also include loans to the following:  
 
 The Veteran and the Veteran’s spouse who is also a Veteran, if both 
entitlements will be used.  
 Entitlement and funding fees are separate. Funding fees are always 
calculated equally by the number of people on the loan.  It is based on 
each Veteran paying their equal share of the loan.  
 On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the funding fee is based on half of the 
base loan amount, downpayment, and sales price for the correct funding 
fee charge. 
 VA will only guarantee the Veteran’s portion of the total loan amount.  
  
 
d. Occupancy   The Veteran using entitlement on a joint loan must certify intent to personally 
occupy the property as his or her home.  
 
 
e. How Many  If a property is to be owned by two or more eligible Veterans, it may consist 
Units Can the  of four family units and one business unit, plus one additional unity for each 
Property  Veteran participating in the ownership.  
Have?   
Thus, two Veterans may purchase or construct residential property consisting 
of up to six family units (the basic four units plus one unit for each of the two 
Veterans), and one business unit. 
                                                                                       Continued on next page

Require Prior   
Approval?   Any loan for which the Veteran and Veteran’s spouse will hold title to the

g. How to  The following underwriting considerations apply: 
Underwrite a  Type of Joint Loan  Underwriting Considerations Function 
Joint Loan  Two Veteran Joint  Consider the credit and combined income and 
Loan  assets of both parties.  Strengths of one Veteran 
related to income and/or assets may compensate for 
income/asset weaknesses of the other.  However, 
satisfactory credit of one Veteran cannot 
compensate for the other’s poor credit. 
Veteran/Non-Veteran  Veteran’s credit must be satisfactory and Veteran’s 
Joint Loan  income must be sufficient to repay that portion of 
the loan allocable to the non-Veteran.  The credit of 
the non-Veteran must be satisfactory.  However, 
the combined income of both borrowers can be 
considered in evaluating repayment ability.   
 
In other words: 
  income strength of the Veteran may 
compensate for income weakness of the 
non-Veteran, but  
  income strength of the non-Veteran cannot 
compensate for income weakness of the 
Veteran in analyzing the Veteran’s ability to 
repay his or her allocable portion of the 
loan.

h. How to  Guaranty is limited to that portion of the loan allocable to the Veteran’s   
Calculate  equal interest in the property. 
Guaranty and   
Entitlement  Percentage of entitlement has no bearing on the amount of the funding fee to 
Use on  be paid. (See Chapter 8). 
Veteran/Non-

Loans  secondary market can be met with this limited guaranty.

i. Procedure  Step  Action 
1  Divide the total loan amount by the number of borrowers. 
2  Multiply the result by the number of Veteran-borrowers who will be 
using entitlement on the loan. 
 
There is usually only one Veteran borrower, in which case the result 
of this Step is the same as the result of Step 1.  
3  Calculate the maximum potential guaranty on the portion of the loan 
arrived at in Step 2 (as if that portion was the total loan). 
4  VA will guarantee the lesser of: 
 
  the maximum potential guaranty amount arrived at in Step 3, 
or 
  the combined available entitlement of all Veteran-borrowers.  
5  VA makes a charge to the Veteran-borrower’s available entitlement 
in the amount of the guaranty. 
 
If more than one Veteran is involved, VA divides the entitlement 
charge equally between them, if possible.  If only unequal 
entitlement is available, unequal charges may be made with the 
written agreement of the Veterans.

l. Procedure,  Step  Action 
continued  1  Calculate the maximum potential guaranty on the total loan amount. 
 
Use the maximum guaranty table in Chapter 3 of this Handbook. 
2  VA will guarantee the lesser of: 
 
• the maximum potential guaranty amount arrived at in Step 1, or 
• the combined available entitlement of all Veteran-borrowers. 
 
If the loan amount is greater than $144,000, additional entitlement 
may be added to each Veteran’s entitlement.  If possible, VA will 
use this additional entitlement to arrive at equal entitlement charges 
for the Veterans involved. 
3  VA will make charges to the Veterans’ available entitlement which 
total the maximum guaranty arrived at in Step 1, or the total of their 
available entitlement if less than the maximum potential guaranty. 
 
VA will divide the entitlement charge equally between the Veterans 
if possible, or, if only unequal entitlement is available, unequal 
charges may be made with the Veterans’ written agreement. 
 
Exception: VA will make the entitlement charge for husband and 
wife Veterans according to their preference.

 no part of the guaranty applies to the portion of the loan allocated to the 
non-Veteran, and  
 in the event of the foreclosure where a loss is sustained, the holder must 
absorb any loss attributable to the non-Veteran’s portion of the loan.  
 
 
 
 
p. Loan  The “Amount of Loan” reflects only the Veteran’s portion of the loan. 
Guaranty   
Certificate  If more than one Veteran used entitlement on the loan, it will reflect the total 
(LGC)  of all portions allocable to those Veterans. 
 
The lender must satisfy itself that the requirements of its investor or the 
secondary market can be met with this limited guaranty. 
 
Whereas the whole loan amount will appear on the mortgage security 
documents; that is, mortgage note or deed of trust, only the Veteran’s portion 
is shown on the Certificate of Commitment and the LGC.

q. Equal  The applicability of the guaranty to only a portion of the loan in the case of a 
Credit  Veteran/non-Veteran joint loan may cause a lender to refuse to accept an 
Opportunity  application for such loan. 
Act   
Consideration This may appear to conflict with the ECOA prohibition against discrimination 
-s (ECOA)  based on marital status; however, the lender may refuse the application under 
these circumstances without violating ECOA. 
 
This is based on an exemption for VA being a special purpose credit program. 
 
r. Calculation  Apply the appropriate funding fee percentage to any portion of the loan   
of the Funding  allocable to a Veteran using his or her entitlement who is not exempt from the 
Fee  funding fee. Determine the appropriate percentage for the type of Veteran 
involved from the funding fee tables in Chapter 8. 
 
Example.  On a no-downpayment loan to two Veterans; on a first-time 
homebuyer; and on a subsequent user; the funding fee percentages of 2.15 
percent and 3.3 percent respectively would each be applied to one-half of the 
loan amount. 
 
No funding fee will be assessed on any portion of a joint loan allocable to a: 
 
 Non-Veteran 
 Veteran who did not use his or her entitlement, or 
 Veteran who used his or her entitlement, but is exempt from the funding 
fee. 
 
Downpayment.  The actual loan amount is allocated equally between the 
borrowers for purposes of calculating the funding fee, whether or not a 
downpayment is made, and regardless of where the funds for such a 
downpayment come from. 
 
 Example.  On a Veteran/non-Veteran loan, the non-Veteran makes a $5,000 
(five percent) downpayment out of his cash resources, to purchase a $100,000 
property, resulting in a $95,000 loan amount. The Veteran is a first-time 
homebuyer.  The Veteran must pay a funding fee of $712.50, based on 1.5 
percent of his/her $47,500 portion.

2. Construction/Permanent Home Loans 
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety  
 
a. The Basics  VA will guarantee a “construction/permanent home loan,” that is, a loan to 
finance the construction/purchase of a residence.  The loan is closed prior to 
the start of construction with proceeds disbursed to cover the cost of, or 
balance owed on, the land, and the balance into escrow.  The escrowed 
monies are paid out to the builder during construction. 
 
The lender must obtain written approval from the borrower before each draw 
payment is provided to the builder.  The loan will not be guaranteed until 
construction is complete and all Notice of Value (NOV) conditions are met. 
 
This section does not address other construction loans guaranteed by VA; that 
is, those for the purchase of a residence newly constructed for the Veteran by 
a builder who financed the construction from his or her own resources. 
 
Lenders should have the specialized experience to originate, process, 
underwrite (borrower, project, and builder), close, service and administer such 
loans.  These types of loans and projects inherently have uncertain elements 
that require careful examination.

b.  The Veteran begins making payments on a construction/permanent home loan 
Amortization  only after construction is complete.  Therefore, the initial payment on the 
principal may be postponed up to 1 year, if necessary.  The loan must be 
amortized to achieve full repayment within its remaining term.  The lender 
must provide evidence of the amortization in the loan file. 
 
Example.  If it takes 6 months to complete construction, the payment schedule 
for the Veteran obtaining a 30-year mortgage must provide for full repayment 
of the loan in 29 years and 6 months.

The VA requirement that loans be amortized with approximately equal 
payments and the principal must be reduced at least once annually, also 
applies to construction loans.  However, the final installment may be for an 
amount up to five percent of the original principal amount of the loan.

d. Interest  Lender’s may offer a “ceiling-floor” where the Veteran “floats” the interest

permanent interest rate will not exceed a specific maximum interest rate and 
permit the borrower to lock-in at a lower rate based on market fluctuations.  
The borrower must qualify for the mortgage at the maximum rate.

3. Energy Efficient Mortgages  
 
Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. What are  Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) are loans to cover the cost of making   
EEMs?  energy efficiency improvements to a dwelling.  They can be made in 
conjunction with a: 
 
  VA loan for the purchase of an existing dwelling, or 
  VA refinancing loan secured by the dwelling. 
 
Acceptable energy efficiency improvements include, but are not limited to: 
 
  solar heating systems, including solar systems for heating water for 
domestic use; 
  solar heating and cooling systems; 
  caulking and weather-stripping; 
  furnace efficiency modifications limited to replacement burners,  
boilers, or furnaces designed to reduce the firing rate or to achieve a 
reduction in the amount of fuel consumed as a result of increased 
combustion efficiency, devices for modifying flue openings which will 
increase the efficiency of the heating system, and electrical or mechanical 
furnace ignition systems which replace standing gas pilot lights; 
  clock thermostats; 
  new or additional ceiling, attic, wall and floor insulation; 
  water heater insulation; 
  storm windows and/or doors, including thermal windows and/or doors; 
  heat pumps; and 
  vapor barriers. 
 
b. Borrower  Information on EEMs is provided to a Veteran who applies for a loan which

amount may be increased as a result of making energy efficiency 
improvements such as: Solar or conventional heating/cooling systems, water 
heaters, insulation, weather-stripping/caulking, and storm windows/doors.  
Other energy related improvements may also be considered.” 
 
The mortgage may be increased by: 
 
  Up to $3,000 based solely on the documented costs, 
  Up to $6,000 provided the increase in monthly mortgage payment 
does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, or 
  VA does not permit EEMs more than $6,000 (38 U.S.C. §3710(d)). 
 
 
 
c. Underwriting  Energy efficiency improvements up to $3,000: The resulting increase in loan

Energy efficiency improvements more than $3,000, up to $6,000: The lender 
must make a determination that the increase in monthly mortgage payments 
does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs, and must rely 
on locally available information provided by utility companies, 
municipalities, state agencies or other reliable sources, and document the 
determination. 
 
Energy efficiency improvements in conjunction with an Interest Rate 
Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL). If the monthly payment (Principal, 
Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI)) for the new loan exceeds the PITI of 
the loan being refinanced by 20 percent or more, the lender must certify to 
having determined that the Veteran qualified for the higher payment.

Entitlement  1  Calculate guaranty on the loan without the portion attributable to    
Use?    the energy efficiency improvements. 
2  Calculate guaranty on the energy efficiency improvements  
portion by applying the same percentage used in Step 1. 
3  Add the results of Steps 1 and 2 to arrive at guaranty on the entire  
loan. 
 
However, the Veteran’s entitlement will only be charged the amount arrived 
at in Step 1; it is based upon the loan amount before adding the cost of the 
energy efficiency improvements. 
 
Example 1: If a Veteran has full entitlement and applies for a loan of 
$80,000, plus $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, VA will guarantee 
40 percent of the full loan amount of $86,000. Thus, the dollar amount of 
the guaranty will be $34,400, even though the charge to the Veteran’s 
entitlement is only $32,000. 
 
Example 2: If a Veteran with full entitlement applies for a $144,000 loan to 
purchase a home, and adds $6,000 in energy efficiency improvements, the 
25 percent guaranty on the loan will only require the use of $36,000 
entitlement, but the dollar amount of guaranty will be $37,500.

  No additional documentation concerning the escrowed/earmarked funds 
must be submitted when reporting the closed loan. 
 
Generally, the improvements should be completed within 6 months from the 
date of loan closing. 
 
Provide written notification to VA when improvements are completed          
and the escrow funds are disbursed.  Escrow requirements concerning 
completion of improvements are listed in Chapter 9 of this handbook.  
 
  Assure the funds are properly applied to the costs of improvements. 
 
If, after a reasonable time, the lender determines that the improvements will 
not be completed: 
 
  Apply the balance of the escrowed/earmarked funds to reduce the  
      principal balance on the loan, and 
  Provide written notification to VA that this has been done.

Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. What is a  A supplemental loan is a loan for the alteration, improvement, or repair of a 
Supplemental  residential property.  The residential property must secure an existing VA-
Loan?  guaranteed loan, and be owned and occupied by the Veteran, or the Veteran 
will reoccupy upon completion of major alterations, repairs, or 
improvements. 
 
The alterations, improvements, or repairs must: 
 
      Be for the purpose of substantially protecting or improving the basic  
     livability, or utility of the property, and 
      Be restricted primarily to the maintenance, replacement, improvement or  
     acquisition of real property, including fixtures. 
 
   Installation of features such as barbecue pits, swimming pools, etc., does     
   not meet this requirement. 
 
No more than 30 percent of the loan proceeds may be used for the 
maintenance, replacement, improvement, repair, or acquisition of non-
fixtures or quasi-fixtures such as refrigeration, cooking, washing, and 
heating equipment.  The equipment must be related to or supplement the 
principal alteration for which the loan is proposed.

 30 years if amortized, or 
 5 years if not amortized.  
 
c. Other  The existing loan must be current with respect to taxes, insurance, and 
Requirements  amortized payments, and must not otherwise be in default unless a primary 
purpose of the supplemental loan is to improve the ability of the borrower to 
maintain the loan obligation. 
 
The making of a supplemental loan can never result in any increase in the rate 
of interest on the existing loan. 
 
A supplemental loan to be written at a higher rate of interest than that payable 
on the existing loan must be evidenced by a separate note from the existing 
loan.

If the cost of the repairs, alterations, or improvements does not exceed $3,500: 
an NOV and compliance inspections are not required.  Instead, a statement of 
reasonable value may be submitted.  The statement must be completed and 
signed by a VA-designated appraiser.  A VA-designated appraiser is an

employee of the lender or its agent) who has been approved by the local VA 
office.   
 
The statement must specify the: 
 
  work done or to be done, 
 purchase price or cost of the work and material, and 
 purchase price or cost does not exceed the reasonable value. 
 
 In lieu of VA compliance inspections, the lender must submit a certification 
as follows: 
 
“The undersigned lender certifies to the Department of Veterans Affairs that 
the property as repaired, altered, or improved has been inspected by a 
qualified individual designated by the undersigned, and based on the 
inspection report, the undersigned has determined that the repairs, alterations, 
or improvements financed with the proceeds of the loan described in the

g. Procedure  If the Veteran has no available entitlement, VA can still guarantee the 
supplemental loan provided the lender is the holder of the Veteran’s existing 
loan and the loans are to be consolidated. 
 
The amount of the modified guaranty will be the maximum guaranty 
effective on the existing loan at the time the supplemental loan is closed. 
 
To calculate the percentage of guaranty applicable to the combined 
indebtedness take the result of Step 1, and divide by the result of Step 3.  
 
Follow the steps in the table below to calculate the percentage of guaranty 
applicable to the combined indebtedness. 
   Step  Action 
1  Take the balance of the existing loan at the time of closing of the 
supplemental loan and multiply by the percentage of guaranty for the 
existing loan, as shown on the guaranty certificate. 
2  Calculate the amount of guaranty that would be issued on the 
supplemental loan as an independent loan (do not exceed the amount 
of entitlement available to the Veteran). 
3  Take the balance of the existing loan and add the amount of the 
supplemental loan. 
4  Take the result of Step 1 above and add the result of Step 2 above. 
5  Divide by the result of Step 3 above.

Change Date   March 11, 2019   
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety.  
 
a. Description  As a marketing tool, builders, sellers, or lenders will sometimes establish and 
fund escrows to temporarily reduce a borrower’s loan payments during the 
initial years of the mortgage.  The borrower may also fund such an escrow for 
herself/himself as a financial management tool. 
 
VA will guaranty loans involving temporary interest rate buydowns, if 
otherwise eligible. 
 
A temporary interest rate buydown can be used in conjunction with any type 
of VA-guaranteed loan. 
 
b. Escrow  Funds must be safely escrowed with an independent third-party escrow agent

funds may be used only for payments due on the note.  The funds may not be 
used to pay past due monthly loan payments. If the loan is foreclosed or 
prepaid, the funds must be credited against the Veteran’s indebtedness. 
 
Escrowed funds may not revert to the party that established the escrow.  If

Borrower 
  
Change Date  November 8, 2012, Change 21 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Policy  The VA Home Loan program involves a veteran’s benefit.  VA policy has 
evolved around the objective of helping the veteran to use his or her home 
loan benefit.  Therefore, VA regulations limit the fees that the veteran can pay 
to obtain a loan. 
 
Lenders must strictly adhere to the limitations on borrower-paid fees and 
charges when making VA loans. 
  
b.  The VA  In order to defray the cost of administering the VA Home Loan program, each 
Funding Fee  veteran must pay a funding fee to VA at loan closing.  
 
Congress may periodically change the funding fee rates to reflect changes in 
the cost of administering the program, or to assist a certain class of veterans.

complies with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).   
 
Section 2, subsections c and d, of this chapter provide some examples of 
items that cannot be charged to the veteran as “itemized fees and charges.”  
 
This section provides more examples of items that cannot be paid by the 
veteran, but can be paid out of the lender’s flat charge or by some party other 
than the veteran. 
  
b.  Attorney’s  The lender may not charge the borrower for attorney’s fees.  However, 
Fees  reasonable fees for title examination work and title insurance can be paid by

VA does not intend to prevent the veteran from seeking independent legal 
representation.  Therefore, the veteran can independently retain an attorney 
and pay a fee for legal services in connection with the purchase of a home.  
Closing documents should clearly indicate that the attorney’s fee is not being 
charged by the lender, but is being paid by the veteran as part of an 
independent arrangement with an attorney.

5. Seller Concessions 
  
Change Date  November 08, 2010, Change 15 
• This section has been updated to make minor grammatical edits. 
  
a.  Definition  For the purposes of this topic, a seller concession is anything of value added 
to the transaction by the builder or seller for which the buyer pays nothing 
additional and which the seller is not customarily expected or required to pay 
or provide.   
  
b.  Seller  Seller concessions include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Concessions   
• payment of the buyer’s VA funding fee 
• prepayment of the buyer’s property taxes and insurance 
• gifts such as a television set or microwave oven 
• payment of extra points to provide permanent interest rate buydowns 
• provision of escrowed funds to provide temporary interest rate buydowns, 
and 
• payoff of credit balances or judgments on behalf of the buyer. 
 
Seller concessions do not include payment of the buyer’s closing costs, or 
payment of points as appropriate to the market. 
 
Example:  If the market dictates an interest rate of 7½ percent with two 
discount points, the seller’s payment of the two points would not be a seller 
concession.  If the seller paid five points, three of these points would be 
considered a seller concession. 
  
c.  The Problem  In some localities, builders or sellers offer concessions as a competitive tool.  
In extreme cases, the concessions may entice unwary and unqualified veterans 
into home mortgages they cannot afford.  The concessions may disguise the 
veteran’s inability to qualify for the loan.

Lender’s Role   
• verify the status of any veteran who may be exempt from paying the 
funding fee; 
• determine the amount of funding fee owed by any non-exempt borrower; 
• collect the appropriate fee from all non-exempt borrowers at loan closing; 
• electronically remit the funds to VA in a timely manner through the VA 
Funding Fee Payment System (FFPS); 
• print proof of payment of the funding fee; and 
• submit proof that the funding fee has been paid or that the veteran is exempt 
from paying the funding fee to VA with the closed loan package.

rating. 
• Veterans entitled to receive compensation, but who are not presently in 
receipt because they are on active duty.  
• Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-

c.  How to  The lender must verify exempt status by obtaining one of the following: 
Verify Exempt   
Status  • a properly completed and signed VA Form 26-8937, Verification of VA 
Benefits, indicating the borrower’s exempt status, 
• for a veteran who elected service retirement pay instead of VA 
compensation, a copy of the original VA notification of disability rating and 
documentation of the veteran’s service retirement income, or 
• indications on the Certificate of Eligibility (COE) that the borrower is 
entitled as an unmarried surviving spouse. 
 
Consult VA if the borrower’s status is unclear after reviewing the appropriate 
documents, or if conflicting information is found. 
  
d.  Loan  Submit a copy of the documentation used to verify exempt status with the 
Submissions  closing package.   
Involving   
Exempt 
Exception:  The lender does not have to submit the documentation if the 
Borrowers 
borrower is an eligible surviving spouse, or the documentation had been 
previously provided to VA with the loan application as verification of the 
veteran’s income. 
 
Note:  A lender who believes that a servicemember may be exempt from 
payment of the funding fee based on a pre-discharge exam should contact the 
VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) of jurisdiction for assistance confirming the 
exempt status.

Be Determined   
Indicate in the closing package that the veteran claims exempt status.  VA 
will determine the borrower’s status and refund the funding fee if appropriate.  
 
If the veteran has a pending disability compensation claim at the time of loan 
closing, the funding fee must be remitted as if the borrower was not exempt. 
 
Advise the veteran to contact the VA RLC to request a refund if it is later 
determined that the veteran is entitled to compensation retroactively to a date 
prior to loan closing.

g.  How to Use  The lender must find the appropriate percentage in the tables using the 
the Funding  following parameters: 
Fee Tables   
• Is the veteran eligible for VA loan benefits through service in the regular 
military or the Reserves/National Guard?  Examine the COE.  For 
Reserves/National Guard, the COE bears the notation, 
“RESERVES/NATIONAL GUARD - INCREASED FUNDING FEE,” and 
is buff-colored rather than green. 
• Is the veteran a subsequent user of VA home loan benefits or obtaining his 
or her first VA loan?  Examine the COE.  An entitlement code of “5” 
indicates subsequent use, as does a loan number entered in the “Loan 
Number” column.  
• What type of loan is the veteran obtaining?  The funding fee varies 
depending upon whether the loan is a purchase or construction loan, an 
IRRRL, or a cash-out refinancing loan. 
• Is the veteran making a downpayment of at least five or ten percent? 
− Calculate what percentage of the sales price of the property the veteran is 
remitting as a downpayment. 
− The downpayment may come from the veteran’s own resources or 
borrowed funds.  Except, if the purchase price exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property, the difference between the purchase price and the 
reasonable value must be paid by the veteran in cash without borrowing. 
• For construction loans only, equity in the secured property counts as a 
downpayment for calculating the funding fee.

regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4337 provide that security instruments used by a 
lender which are inconsistent with VA regulations in effect on the date the 
loan is closed will be considered amended and supplemented to conform to 
the regulations. 
 
Lenders must ensure that the security instruments they use: 
 
  establish the required lien 
  comply with the laws and regulations governing VA’s home loan 
program 
  comply with applicable state laws, and 
  contain the following VA clauses:

c. Other  The mortgage or deed of trust must contain four additional clauses related to 
Clauses  the assumption of the loan.  VA does not specifically require that these 
clauses also be included in the note, unless this is required under state law to 
make them enforceable. Due to variations in local laws, the lender should 
obtain legal guidance as to any minor changes in these sample clauses which 
may be necessary to ensure that they have the effect required by the law and 
regulations; that is, the lender does not have to use the exact language 
provided for these four clauses. 
 
Acceleration Clause 
This loan may be declared immediately due and payable upon transfer of the 
property securing such loan to any transferee, unless the acceptability of the 
assumption of the loan is established pursuant to 38 U.SC. 3714. 
 
Funding Fee Clause 
A fee equal to one-half of one percent of the balance of this loan as of the date 
of transfer of the property shall be payable at the time of transfer to the loan 
holder or its authorized agent, as trustee for the VA. If the assumer fails to pay 
this fee at the time of transfer, the fee shall constitute an additional debt to that 
already secured by this instrument, shall bear interest at the rate herein 
provided, and at the option of the payee of the indebtedness hereby secured or 
any transferee thereof, shall be immediately due and payable.  This fee is 
automatically waived if the assumer is exempt under the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 3729(c). 
 
Processing Charge Clause  
Upon application for approval to allow assumption of this loan, a processing 
fee may be charged by the loan holder or its authorized agent for determining 
the creditworthiness of the assumer and subsequently revising the holder’s 
ownership records when an approved transfer is completed. The amount of 
this charge shall not exceed the maximum established by VA for a loan to 
which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies. 
 
Indemnity Liability Assumption Clause 
If this obligation is assumed, then the assumer hereby agrees to assume all of 
the obligations of the Veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and 
securing the loan. The assumer further agrees to indemnify VA to the extent 
of any claim payment arising from the guaranty or insurance of the 
indebtedness created by this instrument.

2. Escape Clause and Notice of Value (NOV)  
 
Change Date  July 30, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Sales  The Escape Clause must be contained in the sales contract for all VA-
Contract  guaranteed loans.   The lender is responsible for ensuring that the paragraph is 
in the sales contract prior to closing.  In the event the clause is not in the sales 
contract, VA may not guaranty the loan. 
 
b. Builders and  The builders/realtors that initiate contracts on new construction must ensure 
Realtors  that the Escape Clause is in the contract and the contract is signed by the 
Veteran and seller. 
 
c. Upgrades  Upgrades are not considered earnest money and the builder is not required to 
refund this money.  When the NOV is below the sales contract price, this 
clause protects the Veteran with negotiation of the sales contract. 
 
d. Escape  If the sales contract was signed by the Veteran prior to receipt of the NOV, 
Clause  the contract must include, or be amended to include, the clause below. 
 
“It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
contract, the purchaser shall not incur any penalty by forfeiture of earnest 
money or otherwise or be obligated to complete the purchase of the property 
described herein, if the contract purchase price or cost exceeds the reasonable 
value of the property established by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The 
purchaser shall, however, have the privilege and option of proceeding with the 
consummation of this contract without regard to the amount of the reasonable 
value established by the Department of Veterans Affairs (38 U.S.C. 501, 
3703(c)(1)).”   
 
This clause may be found at 38 C.F.R. 36.4303(k)(4) in its entirety.

3.  Title Limitations 
   
Change Date  July 30, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Estate of the  VA regulations at 38 C.F.R. 36.4354 provide the parameters for the required 
Veteran in the  estate of a Veteran in real property securing a VA-guaranteed loan. 
Property   
The lender is responsible for ensuring the loan conforms to these parameters.  
For IRRRLs (see Chapter 6, Topic 6, Item k of this handbook). 
 
A beneficial interest in a revocable Family Living Trust that ensures that the 
Veteran, or Veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the 
lien attaches to any remainder interest and the trust arrangement is valid under 
state law. 
   
b. Estate Title   Generally, title to the estate shall be that which is acceptable to informed 
buyers, title companies, and attorneys in the community in which the 
property is situated. 
   
c. Mortgage  VA does not allow an individual to take title to a property if that individual is  
Note or Deed  not on either the mortgage note or a mortgage deed of trust.  Accordingly, if  
a spouse or other owner does not want to sign a mortgage note and be  
obligated for a VA-guaranteed home loan that individual must sign a  
mortgage deed of trust. 
   
d.  Title  VA does not require a lender making a VA loan or the Veteran-borrower to  
Insurance  obtain title insurance.  The lender may apply its own title insurance 
requirements to VA loan transactions.  VA requires only that title to the  
property meet the standards described above in “Estate of the Veteran in the 
Property.”

the legal instruments require acceleration of the loan if it is assumed 
by a party ineligible for assistance under the program. 
  Such acceleration must be mandated by federal, state, territorial, or 
local law or regulation. 
 
VA may guarantee a loan made through a state or local government program, 
designed to assist low-or moderate-income individuals, which imposes 
resale and price restrictions on purchasers.  Under such a program, if the 
property is resold within a period established by local law or ordinance, 
certain restrictions as set forth in 38 C.F.R. 36.4354(b)(5)(iv)(A) on to whom 
the property may be sold, the resale price, and other restrictions approved by 
the Secretary may be applied. 
 
VA may guarantee a loan on which a title restriction limits the sale, lease, or 
occupancy of the dwelling to persons based on age, including a prohibition 
against the permanent occupancy of the dwelling by children, provided such 
restriction complies with applicable federal law (38 U.S.C. 3704(c)).   
 
VA may refuse to approve a property with an age restriction if its operation 
would create an undue hardship upon the owner in the case of sudden, 
unforeseen events or be likely to result in an increased risk of loan default.

Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
   
a. Policy  Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3703(d)(3)(A), a VA-guaranteed loan must be 
  secured by a first lien on the realty.  Lenders are responsible for properly

on the property must be paid off or subordinated to the VA loan. 
   
b. Eligibility  A loan to purchase property subject to unpaid delinquent taxes, special 
assessments, prior mortgage indebtedness, or other obligations secured by 
effective liens that the Veteran agrees to pay or which constitute 
encumbrances on the property is not eligible for guaranty, if the loan amount,

Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Policy  Loans for the purchase and construction of homes will be first liens, subject 
only to taxes, special assessments, and ground rents.  VA will not approve 
superior liens in favor of private entities unless they: 
 
  are legally or practically necessary, and 
  result in no prejudice to the Veterans or the Government. 
   
b.  The lender must obtain VA prior approval of liens held by private parties 
Requirements  which are superior to VA home mortgage liens.  Liens held by mandatory 
membership home associations in planned unit developments are not 
addressed in this topic.  The lender must demonstrate that: 
 
  it is not legal or practical to subordinate the superior lien to the VA 
mortgage, 
  there is a viable rationale for not subordinating the superior lien, 
  the superior lien will not prejudice Veterans or the Government, and 
  if periodic charges or assessments are involved, the amounts are 
reasonable and limits on the amounts have been established. 
 
   
c. VA Approval  Always obtain VA approval before the lien is recorded. Builders and 
developers should be aware that if they plan to market properties through VA 
financing, covenants creating superior liens should not be recorded without  
VA approval.

d. Examples   VA may find the following types of superior liens acceptable (38 C.F.R. 
36.4356): 
 
  Liens for taxes, assessments, and ground rents. 
  Liens by private entities to secure assessments or charges for 
municipal- type services and facilities which: 
o  are clearly governmental in nature, and  
o  a municipality could support out of public tax revenue if it 
provided the service, but the municipality does not provide 
them. 
  Liens to implement or augment a service or facility if the 
government’s provision of such service or facility is inadequate. 
  Liens for services or facilities in locations where the services or 
facilities are adequately supplied by local government generally will 
not be approved by VA. 
  Liens created by recorded covenants in favor of private entities to 
secure the homeowner’s share of the costs of the management, 
operation, maintenance, services, or programs for the benefit of a 
development. 
  Liens (on existing properties) previously retained by trustees, 
improvement associations or other nongovernmental entities for 
community-type services and facilities in a given area or subdivision, 
such as maintenance of streets, parkways, playgrounds, water systems, 
sewage systems, police and fire protection, or street lighting.

8.  Power of Attorney (POA) 
    
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Policy  VA will allow a Veteran to use an attorney-in-fact to execute any documents 
necessary to obtain a VA-guaranteed loan.  This enables active duty 
servicepersons stationed overseas, and other Veterans who cannot be present 
to execute loan documents, to obtain VA loans. 
 
b.  The Veteran must execute a general or specific POA which is valid and 
Requirements  legally adequate.  The Veteran’s attorney-in-fact (as specified in the POA) 
must use this POA to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and initiate 
processing of a loan on behalf of the Veteran.  A military POA is considered a 
general POA and is only valid during the Active Duty Servicemembers’ 
(ADSM) period of deployment, not to exceed 1 year. 
 
To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, ensure that the 
general or specific POA complies with state law to the extent that: 
 
  the mortgage can be legally enforced in that jurisdiction, and 
  clear title can be conveyed in the event of foreclosure. 
 
To complete the loan transaction using an attorney-in-fact, VA also requires 
the Veteran’s written consent to the specifics of the transaction either through 
a general POA or a specific POA. 
 
General POA - The Veteran’s signature on both the sales contract and the 
Uniform Residential Loan Application, as long as the Veteran’s intention to 
obtain a VA loan on the particular property is expressed somewhere in those 
documents.

c.  Veteran’s  The lender must always verify that the Veteran is alive at the time of loan 
Status as Alive  closing, whether or not the Veteran is an ADSM in the military. If on active 
and not MIA  military duty, the Veteran must not be missing in action (MIA). 
 
The lender must make the following certification at the time of loan closing: 
 
“The undersigned lender certifies that written evidence in the form of 
correspondence from the Veteran or, if on active military duty, statement of 
his or her commanding officer (including statement of person authorized to 
act for said officer), affirmatively indicating that the Veteran was alive 
and, if the Veteran is on active military duty, not missing in action status 
on (date), was examined by the undersigned and that the said date is on or 
subsequent (not prior) to the date the note and security instruments were 
executed on the Veteran’s behalf by the attorney-in-fact.” 
 
VA may deny guaranty on a loan if the lender failed to properly verify the 
Veteran’s status and the Veteran was deceased (or MIA) at the time the loan 
was closed. 
                       
d.  Digital  Digital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature

Act, commonly referred to as the E-sign Act.

9.  Lender Review of Sales Contracts on Proposed 
Construction 
     
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. Procedures  Prior to requesting an appraisal of proposed construction, the lender must 
review the sales contract or purchase agreement on the property.  The lender 
must determine whether the contract: 
 
  is acceptable, and 
  does not contain unfair contractual provisions. 
    
b. Revisions  The lender must request revisions of an unacceptable contract by the parties 
to the transaction.  The lender should report unacceptable contract practices 
by a VA program participant (such as a builder) to VA if: 
 
  the program participant is engaged in practices which seriously 
prejudice the interests of Veterans or the Government, or 
  the program participant repeatedly uses unacceptable contracts or 
contracts containing unfair contractual provisions, and is 
uncooperative in changing such practices 
   
c. Closing  The closing of the loan indicates that the lender has determined the contract is 
acceptable. 
   
d. Examples of  Example  Unfair Contract Provisions or Features 
Unfair 
1  Provisions allowing the downpayment or earnest money of the 
Contract 
purchaser to be forfeited or retained as liquidated damages if 
Provisions or 
the purchaser cannot obtain VA financing. 
Features 
2  Inclusion in a lump-sum contract of an “escalator clause” which 
obligates the purchaser to pay a higher price in the event of 
increased costs for labor, material, or other items prior to delivery 
of title unless accompanied by a proviso which gives the 
purchaser the option of canceling the contract and obtaining a 
refund of the moneys paid, if the increased price is not acceptable 
to the buyer/Veteran.

C.F.R. 36.4354(b)(5). 
4  A requirement that purchasers waive or release any claim or right 
for nonperformance by the builder under the contract. 
 
This does not prevent a builder from obtaining a statement from 
the purchaser at closing that he or she has inspected the house and 
has not observed any unsatisfactory construction, nor does it 
prevent the builder from obtaining a release from the purchaser in 
settlement of a bona fide dispute. 
5  Omission of an accurate property description. 
6  Omission of a provision specifying whether the builder or the 
Veteran is to be charged with any special assessments or 
improvement bonds. This includes those assessments or bonds 
which are payable in the future, for improvements included in the 
plans and specifications or commenced or completed at the time of 
closing, such as streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and sewers.

failure to give the Veteran the option of canceling the contract and 
obtaining a refund of the deposit if the dwelling is not completed 
on a specified date or within a reasonable time.  
8  Failure of a contract covering proposed construction to obligate the 
seller to complete the dwelling in substantial accordance with 
identified and definite plans and specifications.

11.  Hazard Insurance 
  
Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. General  The lender is responsible for ensuring that hazard insurance is obtained prior 
Requirements  to loan closing, and maintained for the term of the loan.  It must be of an 
insurance type or types and in an amount sufficient to protect the property 
against risks or hazards to which it may be subjected in the locality.  
Generally, the type(s) and amount of insurance coverage customary in the 
locality will satisfy this requirement.  Policies must provide that all amounts 
payable, including unearned premiums, shall be payable to the holder, or to a 
trustee or other person for the holder.  All policy payments received for 
insured losses must be applied to the restoration of the security or to the loan 
balance. 
 
b. Flood  The lender is responsible for ensuring that flood insurance is obtained and 
Insurance  maintained on any building or personal property that secures a VA loan if the 
Requirements  property is located in a special flood hazard area (SFHA), as identified by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The following flood 
insurance considerations may apply: 
 
  The lender/holder’s responsibility extends through the entire term of 
the loan, and includes insuring any secured property that becomes 
newly located in a SFHA due to FEMA remapping. 
 
  The VA appraiser’s opinion on whether the property is located in a 
SFHA does not relieve the lender from responsibility for ensuring 
flood insurance coverage on a property which is in fact located in a 
SFHA. 
 
  Personal property requiring coverage can include a manufactured 
home and its appliances, carpet, etc. if they secure the loan.

Requirements, 
coverage available for the particular type(s) of property under the 
continued 
National Flood Insurance Act. 
 
  Contact local property insurance agents or brokers, or FEMA regional 
offices, for current information on maximum available coverage. 
 
Note: VA cannot guarantee a loan if the security is located in a SFHA and 
flood insurance is not available. 
   
c.  VA may reduce a future guaranty claim based on the lender’s noncompliance 
Consequences  with VA hazard/flood insurance requirements which results in uninsured 
of Uninsured  losses (unless a waiver has been granted).  The lender must determine the 
Losses 
minimum insurance coverage needed to meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. 
36.4329 for a specific loan.  If the required amount of coverage is maintained, 
no future guaranty claim can be reduced due to inadequate coverage provided 
there has been no change in the nature, value, or use of the security that 
would require new or additional coverage (based on what is customary in the 
locality) since VA’s determination was made.

d. Special  Condominiums and many townhouse homeowners associations (HOAs) 
Considerations  maintain blanket or master policies on common areas, including common 
with  mechanical and structural elements.  The limits of coverage should be 
Homeowners  described in the policy, and may also be referred to in the organizational 
Associations 
documents.  Lenders should be aware that policies maintained by some HOAs 
may not provide adequate coverage.   
 
Condominium HOAs may protect only the shell of the structure. These “studs 
out” policies do not cover: 
 
  interior walls, 
  flooring, 
  plumbing or electrical fixtures, 
  cabinets, 
  heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, 
  appliances, and 
  other items considered part of the real property. 
 
Carefully review the terms of each blanket policy, or confirm with the HOA 
that adequate coverage is in effect (and check periodically for any changes in 
coverage).  If coverage is inadequate, the homeowner can be held responsible 
through the terms of the loan instruments, for maintaining coverage on the 
portions of the real property not covered by the master policy.

Change Date  July 30, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
    
a. General  VA permits Veteran purchasers to utilize HAP services when obtaining a VA 
Information  home loan. Both government and private entities administer HAPs. 
 
  Lenders are not required to obtain VA approval of such programs 
before closing the loan.  Homebuyer assistance programs that are 
administered by a state, county, or municipal government entity have 
blanket approval for use with VA loans.  These state and local 
programs are not to be confused with the Department of Defense 
HAP. 
  HAPs that do not fall under the blanket approval, should forward the 
documentation to the VA RLC with jurisdiction over property state.  
     
b.  Lenders making VA loans involving HAPs must ensure the following: 
Requirements   
  the borrower(s) meet(s) VA credit standards,  
  the lender obtains a VA appraisal, and  
  the property must meet VA minimum property standards. 
 
If the sale price of the property exceeds the VA reasonable value of the 
property, VA will only allow HAP assistance in the form of a grant to pay 
the difference.  Otherwise the Veteran must pay the difference of price 
over value from his or her own funds without borrowing. 
 
HAPs often require buyers to occupy the property for a specified period of 
time.  The lender must, at closing, obtain the borrower’s 
acknowledgement of this requirement, and provide a copy of the signed 
acknowledgement if VA requests the loan file for review.

c. HAP Fees  Chapter 8 of this handbook lists closing charges that Veteran-borrowers are not 
allowed to pay when a one-percent loan origination fee is charged.  Since HAPs 
are designed to assist low to moderate income buyers, lenders may not charge 
Veteran-borrowers unallowable fees and use HAP funds to offset these charges 
since this practice dilutes the assistance that the HAP was intended to provide.

1.  Appraisal Process Summary 
    
Change Date  March 11, 2019 
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Purpose  Appraisals are performed to protect the interests of Veterans, lenders, 
servicers and VA.   
   
b. Appraisals  Authorized requesters may order appraisals online in WebLGY only after a 
Requested  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) has been requested.  In most cases, VA will 
Online  automatically assign an appraiser on VA’s fee appraiser panel to perform the 
appraisal. 
   
c. Appraisal  The fee appraiser will estimate the market value of the property in accordance 
Guidelines  with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and 
VA appraisal guidelines.  The appraiser will note any readily apparent repairs 
needed for the property to meet VA’s Minimum Property Requirements 
(MPRs). 
    
d. Appraisal  The completed appraisal report will be uploaded into WebLGY and 
Review  electronically scored by VA’s Appraisal Management System (AMS).  A 
Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) employed by a lender or servicer, or VA

Appraisal   described in the appraisal (see Chapter 12, Topic 12 of this

  A property that is primarily non-residential is ineligible for VA loan 
guaranty (see Chapter 12, Topic 11 of this Handbook). 
 
  For new and proposed construction cases, if the local building 
authority routinely performs construction inspections, but none were 
conducted, the property is ineligible for VA loan guaranty (see Topic 
14 of this chapter). 
 
  Condo-hotel properties (Condotels) where units are placed in a rental 
pool and “air” condominiums that do not have a homeowners 
association are not eligible for an appraisal. (see Chapter 11, Topic 12 
of this Handbook.) 
 
  A property is ineligible for an appraisal if any party of interest to the 
transaction, other than the purchaser, is debarred Government-wide, or 
excluded from participation in the Loan Guaranty program due to a 
VA-imposed sanction. Sanctions typically involve construction 
complaints or unfair marketing practices.  Lenders must confirm that 
builders of properties appraised as new or proposed construction have 
a valid VA-issued builder ID number to ensure that sanctioned 
builders do not participate in the VA Home Loan Guaranty program 
(see Topic 11 of this chapter). If the sanctioned party is a builder, this 
restriction applies to any property still owned by the builder, including 
houses under construction and existing houses.  VA’s refusal to 
appraise will not be affected by either the fact that the local building 
authority approved the work on which the sanction was based, or the 
builder changes the company’s name or organizational structure or 
becomes a principal or officer in another organization.

questions about property eligibility or if the property is not eligible, but is 
already the security for a VA loan 
3  Request for Certificate of Eligibility (COE)

  Step  Action 
8  If the Veteran is purchasing a home, the same day the assignment is made, the 
requester must upload a copy of the sales contract and any construction 
exhibits into WebLGY. VA highly recommends the use of reduced-size 
construction drawings to save copying, mailing, and storage costs for all 
parties involved. Building plans, elevations and details, traditionally drawn at 
¼ inch scale and larger, can be photographically reduced or computer-drawn 
to be clearly readable on 8½ by 14-inch pages. Other exhibits normally 
provided in an 8½ by 11-inch format (such as specifications, certifications, 
etc.) must not be further reduced.  VA does not accept 11 by 17-inch pages as 
this size is not compatible with scanning equipment generally available to 
program participants. 
9  For all appraisal types, if the legal description is lengthy and does not fit in the 
legal description block on the appraisal request, a copy of the complete legal 
description must be uploaded into WebLGY the same day the assignment is 
made. 
10  In most cases, the appraisal will be assigned instantly.  If an appraiser is not 
assigned by WebLGY, please notify the RLC of jurisdiction. Requesters must 
not re-enter the information as a duplicate appraisal request will be generated.

2. Market Value 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Market  The appraiser must estimate the market value, as "the most probable price that 
Value  a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions 
Definition  requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, 
knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.”  
VA considers reasonable value and market value to be synonymous.  VA’s 
definition of market value is consistent with that used by Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and major appraisal organizations.  
 
b. Protecting  The quality of the appraisal is critical in protecting the interests of Veterans, 
the Interests of  lenders, servicers, and VA.  This fact requires VA to be integrally involved in 
Veterans,  its management and oversight of the appraisal process, from the initial 
Lenders, 
assignment of the appraiser through the issuance of the Notice of Value 
Servicers and 
(NOV), as well as oversight performed on closed loans. 
VA 
 
c. Oversight  Any appraisal report is unacceptable if the analysis is not based upon 
recognized appraisal practices and was intended to "accommodate" or "meet" 
the sales price.

i. Appraisal  In most cases, the appraiser will prepare the appraisal on Fannie Mae Form 
Requirements  1073, Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report.  Appraisals of 
manufactured home condominium units must be prepared on Fannie Mae 
Form 1004C, Manufactured Home Appraisal Report, with the details about 
the condominium development usually provided in the Project Information 
Section of the condominium appraisal form included within the appraisal

Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Definition  The UAD improves the quality and consistency of appraisal data by defining 
all fields required on specific appraisal forms and standardizes definitions and 
responses for a key subset of fields. Regardless of the geographic location of 
the property or any localized reporting conventions, the UAD standardization 
includes: 
 
  Formats for fields that include dates, values, and other data,  
  Allowable values from a list of choices provided for certain fields, 
  Abbreviations to allow more information to fit on printed appraisal 
forms, and  
  Ratings and definitions for the “Condition” and “Quality” of the 
property and “Updated/Remodeled” status. 
 
b. UAD- Appraisals prepared on Fannie Mae Forms 1004, 1073, 1075 or 2055 must be 
Compliant  UAD-compliant and must include the definitions for the property condition 
Forms  and quality ratings and the property description abbreviations used.  
 
c. VA Requires  While the UAD may allow for the use of pending sales in the sales 
Closed Sales  comparison grid, VA requires that only closed sales be used. 
 
d. Remodeling  UAD requires appraisers to provide specific information regarding 
Information  remodeling in the past 15 years.  VA expects fee appraisers to recognize and 
describe remodeling or updating and to make appropriate adjustments. Fee 
appraisers should also report UAD information concerning the remodeling if 
it is available in the “normal course of business” within VA timeliness 
requirements for completion of the appraisal. 
 
e. UAD  Since origination appraisals are prepared “subject to” any repairs needed for

14.  Sales Comparison Approach 
 
Change Date  February 22, 2019 
  This Chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Comparable  The appraiser must include, at a minimum, three closed sales which the 
Sale Selection  appraiser believes are the best available sales and provide comments to 
support the selection, when appropriate.  Comparable sales should be selected 
based on similar locational and physical characteristics, not sales price.  
Recent sales in the same established subdivision, condominium or PUD are 
typically the best indicators of value.  The sales should be similar to the 
subject property to the extent that the sales would be competing properties if 
they were on the market at the same time as the subject property. 
 
b. Comments  The appraiser should provide comments when adjustments are made for 
Explaining  points of comparison that are not self-explanatory or when large adjustments 
Adjustments  are made.  Providing detailed commentary about the market and comparable 
selection may reduce the number of requests for revisions of appraisals. 
 
c. Limited Sales  If the sales data from the market area is limited, the appraiser must provide the 
Data  best information available and comments with the appraiser’s professional 
opinion about the market, any reasons for the lack of sales data, and the 
various differences between the subject and the comparable sales. 
 
d. Distance of  VA does not set minimum or maximum distance requirements between the 
Comparable  subject and comparable sale properties.  In suburban or rural communities, the 
Sales  market areas may be greatly expanded and suitable comparable sales may be 
many miles away from the subject. In such cases, the appraiser should specify 
why those comparable sales were used and how they compare with the 
subject.  
 
e. Sales of REO  The appraiser may use sales of Real Estate Owned (REO) properties or short 
Properties  sales if transactions of this nature are prevalent in the market.  A transaction 
involving a foreclosure transfer to a mortgage servicer is not evidence of 
market value and must not be considered as a comparable sale.

f. Sales From  If the property is in a new subdivision or condominium, the appraiser should 
Competing  include, if available for comparison, properties constructed by a competing 
Developments  builder in the subject market area as well as properties within the subject 
subdivision or condominium. 
 
g. Market- All adjustments on the market data grid should be market-derived, based on 
derived  the amount the appraiser estimates a typical buyer would pay for the item in 
Adjustments  the market.  Adjustments reflect contributory value in the market, which does 
not necessarily equal the cost of an item. 
 
h. Sales  Sales concessions typically include financing incentives or non-realty items.  
Concessions  As all adjustments must be market-derived, the adjustment should reflect the 
difference between the sales price with the sales concessions, and what the 
property would have sold for without the concessions under typical market 
conditions.  The sales concessions on the comparable properties are adjusted 
to typical market expectations, not to the specific terms or conditions of the 
sale of the subject. Any concession adjustments must be downward 
adjustments as positive adjustments for sales concessions are not acceptable. 
 
i. Recent Sales  Comparable sales should reflect the most recent activity in the market.  
Comparable sales are preferably sales that have taken place within the last 6 
months, and generally sales that are not more than 12-months old, unless 
explained by the appraiser.

j. Time  Market condition (time) adjustments are made to reflect value changes in the 
Adjustments  market between the date of the contract for the comparable sale and the 
effective date of the appraisal.  The appraiser must provide comments about 
current market trends to support any time adjustments.  
 
In an increasing market, positive market condition adjustments should be 
made if there is evidence, based on a thorough analysis of specific market 
trends, of increasing prices, a shortage of homes for sale, or decreasing 
marketing times. 
 
In a declining market, negative market condition adjustments should be made 
if there is evidence of a decline in prices, an oversupply, or extended 
marketing times.  
 
k. Condition  Since VA appraisals must be prepared “subject to” the completion of any 
Adjustments  repairs needed in order for the property to meet VA’s MPRs (see Chapter 12 
of this handbook), the condition for the subject property compared with the 
comparable sales on the market data grid should reflect the condition with the 
repair items completed.

making condition adjustments on the market data grid since 
liquidation appraisals are completed “as is”.

2. Scope of Appraisal Review 
 
Change Date  July 22, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. SAR’s  When issuing an NOV in WebLGY, the SAR must electronically certify the 
Certification of  following: “I reviewed this appraisal report to determine the acceptability of 
Appraisal  the property for VA Loan Guaranty purposes in light of VA minimum property 
Review 
requirements and the appropriateness, completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the fee appraiser’s reasonable value determination. In completing 
this administrative review, I am performing a due diligence function and not 
acting as, or taking the responsibility of, a cosigner of the report or 
supervisory appraiser.  Any disagreements or comments, etc., resulting from 
the administrative review of this appraisal are fully explained on the 
attachment to this report.”  (WebLGY notes are considered “the attachment to 
this report” referenced in this certification). 
 
b. SAR’s  By making this certification together with the certifications already made 
Responsibilities  when initially approved by VA, the SAR is certifying that he/she: 
 
  personally reviewed the appraisal report (see Topic 3 of this Chapter), 
  concurred with the fee appraiser’s recommendation, except as 
noted in WebLGY notes, 
  did not exert pressure or undue influence on the appraiser to change 
information or to reach a predetermined value for the subject property 
in order to accommodate the sale price or mortgage transaction, and 
  determined that the appraiser used methodologies that were 
appropriate and reasonable in light of industry-accepted appraisal 
techniques, made conclusions that were consistent, based upon the 
data in the report, and complied with applicable VA requirements.

Guidelines 
  the appraisal report meets VA guidelines as outlined in Chapters 10, 
11, and 12 of this Handbook. 
 
c. MPR Repairs  The SAR must review the appraiser’s recommendations for any VA Minimum 
Property Requirement (MPR) repairs and ensure that the property meets or 
will meet VA’s MPRs.  The SAR must limit repairs required on the NOV to 
only those repairs that are needed for the property to meet MPRs.  SARs must 
place notes in WebLGY justifying any non-MPR repairs or inspections 
recommended by appraisers that the SAR has determined are not required on 
the NOV. 
 
d.  During the review of an appraisal, in most cases, when a question arises, the 
Clarifications  SAR should first contact the appraiser for any needed clarifications and 
on the  corrections. The SAR must document any contact with the appraiser and

4. Appraisal Management System  
 
Change Date  July 22, 2019  
  This chapter has been revised in its entirety. 
 
a. Electronic  When the appraiser uploads the completed appraisal report into WebLGY, 
Scoring of the  VA’s Appraisal Management System (AMS) will electronically read and 
Appraisal  score the appraisal, assisting SARs in quickly assessing appraisal risk, 
determining property eligibility, ensuring VA policy compliance and 
identifying over/under-valuations, and appraisal quality issues. SARs must 
use AMS as a tool to help ensure appraisals are accurate, complete, and that 
the property is properly valued according to VA-accepted appraisal principles 
and practices. 
 
b. Business  As a rules-based system, AMS will assist SARs in finding inconsistencies by 
Rules in AMS  flagging items as potentially problematic, and determining whether the 
appraisal is in compliance with VA appraisal requirements, industry-accepted 
appraisal principles, and Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice (USPAP). 
 
c. Alerts  Alerts will be noted by the AMS based on VA’s business rules.  All high 
Provided by  alerts must be addressed in WebLGY notes.  Medium and low alerts do not 
AMS  require a comment, but should be carefully reviewed by the SAR.  Often the 
alerts will reflect an NOV condition that must be required, with no 
clarification needed from the appraiser. 
 
d. VA Guidance  VA will issue a circular periodically describing the AMS scores that will be 
on Specific  considered low-risk and high-risk appraisals.  SARs may perform a cursory 
AMS Scores  review on low-risk appraisals.  High-risk appraisals require a comprehensive 
review. Sometimes a score of “N/A” will be reported for complex, rural, or 
new/proposed construction properties due to a lack of market data.  While this 
is not an indication of a high-risk appraisal, a comprehensive review must be 
performed since the AMS did not return a score within the acceptable range 
for a cursory review.   SARs must indicate whether or not a cursory review 
was performed in WebLGY with the indicator on the screen where the NOV 
is issued.

conclusions are consistent with those in similar cases recently 
processed. 
 
h. Systems Not  If system issues arise and AMS results are not available, the SAR may 
in Operation  perform a comprehensive review, noting in WebLGY that AMS results were 
not available.  If WebLGY is not available, the SAR may issue the NOV 
outside of WebLGY, entering the NOV in WebLGY when the system is back 
online.  A note should be entered documenting that this procedure was 
followed.

c. Table of   
NOV  NOV Condition  Details for including this condition on an NOV 
Conditions, 
1. Energy Conservation  Item 1a should be marked on NOVs for existing 
continued 
properties (over 1-year old or previously occupied) to 
allow lenders to increase the loan amount for Veterans 
wishing to make energy efficiency improvements (see 
Chapter 7 of this Handbook).  Item 1b should be 
marked on NOVs for new or proposed construction 
excluding manufactured homes. For new and proposed 
manufactured homes, energy efficiency is already 
covered by the manufacturer’s guidelines (see Chapter 
12, Topic 42 of this Handbook) so this item should not 
be marked.   
2.  Wood Destroying  If the property is located in an area on the Termite 
Insect Information  Infestation Probability Map where the probability of 
termite infestation is "very heavy" or "moderate to 
heavy," a wood destroying insect inspection report 
must be required on the Notice of Value (NOV).  Mark 
2a if the property is existing or new construction, or 
item 2b if the property is proposed. For new 
construction, if a soil treatment guarantee is provided, 
this is preferable and will satisfy condition 2a.  The 
pest control operator must meet all state requirements. 
State-required inspection forms are acceptable.  
Inspection reports are valid for 90 days.  Soil treatment 
guarantees differ from an inspection and are 
consequently valid well beyond 90 days.  A wood-
destroying insect inspection is not required on units in 
low-rise or high-rise condominiums (units are stacked 
vertically) unless the appraiser notes a potential 
infestation problem.  For site condominiums, and villa 
or townhome style condominiums where units are not 
vertically stacked, an inspection must be required on 
the NOV unless evidence of a treatment guarantee has 
been provided by the homeowners association.

if the condominium is fully accepted by VA.  If the 
condominium has not been accepted by VA, the NOV 
must not be issued.  (See Chapter 11, Topic 12 of this 
Handbook). 
5. Private Road/Shared  If access to the property is by a private road or shared 
Driveway  driveway, this item should be marked, unless the 
property is in a PUD or condominium with private 
streets which are covered by the organizational 
documents.  If a state law establishes requirements for 
the maintenance of private roads, this condition is not 
needed on the NOV.  
6. Flood Insurance  If the property is located in a Special Flood Hazard 
Area, this item must be marked. It is the lender's 
responsibility to ensure that flood insurance is 
obtained and maintained on properties located in 
SFHAs, whether or not the appraiser correctly 
identifies the property as being in an SFHA.  If flood 
insurance is not available, a property in a SFHA is not 
eligible to be the security for a VA-guaranteed loan. 
7. Water/Sewage  If the property has an individual water supply, such as 
System Acceptability  a well, this condition must be marked.  For proposed 
construction cases, acceptance of an individual sewage 
system must be required.  Acceptance of the sewage 
system is also required for existing or new 
construction cases in which there is an indication of a 
problem or the property is in an area known to have 
soil percolation problems. Certifications are valid for 
90 days unless the local authority indicates otherwise.

Dear [Mr. or Ms.]  [Veteran’s last name]: 
 
The above property has been appraised by a fee appraiser assigned by the VA Regional Loan Center in [ 
RLC City and State]. On [date NOV issued], the VA-authorized appraisal reviewer personally reviewed the fee 
appraiser's report and determined the property's estimated reasonable value to be $[ value ]. The maximum 
repayment period for a loan secured by this property is [30 years or estimated remaining economic life on 
appraisal, whichever is less].   
   
The VA appraisal was made to determine the reasonable value of the property for loan purposes. 
The appraisal must not be considered a building inspection. Neither VA nor the lender can guarantee that 
the home will be satisfactory to you in all respects or that all equipment will operate properly. A thorough 
inspection of the property by you or a reputable inspection firm may help minimize any problems that 
could arise after loan closing. In an existing home, particular attention should be given to plumbing, 
heating, electrical and roofing components. VA recommends testing for radon, which the government has 
determined can cause lung cancer.   
   
REMEMBER: VA GUARANTEES THE LOAN, NOT THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY

Overview 
  
Change Date  June 28, 2010, Change 14 
 This section has been updated to add subsection lettering and to make 
minor grammatical edits. 
  
a. Purpose of  The purpose of the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) is to 
LAPP  speed up the time to loan closing by allowing VA-authorized lenders to 
receive appraisal reports directly from appraisers and process them 
without VA involvement. 
  
b. How LAPP  There are basically four steps in processing LAPP cases. 
Works 
 
Stage  Description 
1  The LAPP lender requests VA assignment of a fee appraiser 
and a VA loan number (same as any other case) and identifies 
the case as “LAPP.” 
2  The VA-assigned appraiser sends the appraisal report directly 
to the LAPP lender’s VA-approved staff appraisal reviewer 
(SAR). 
3  The LAPP lender’s SAR 
 
 reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques as 
well as other VA requirements, 
 determines the reasonable value of the property and any 
conditions which must be met prior to VA guaranty of the 
loan, and 
 sends the veteran buyer a written notice of the value which 
includes any conditions or requirements upon which the VA 
loan guaranty is contingent. 
4  The LAPP lender then underwrites and closes the loan on the 
automatic basis and requests VA guaranty.

Common Interest Communities 
  
Introduction  While only condominiums must be approved by VA, lots or units securing VA loans  
in condominiums and other planned unit developments must meet both title and lien-related VA 
regulatory requirements.  The lender is responsible for ensuring that these requirements are met for 
each VA loan.  Although there is no specific VA requirement that lenders maintain evidence in the 
loan file that these requirements are met, they may wish to be guided by the advice of their legal 
counsel in this regard. 
 
Acceptable  The title requirements for every VA loan, whether or not the property is located in a common 
Title  interest communities, are stated in VA regulations 
(38 CFR 36.4350).  These requirements indicate 
 
 the estate must not be less than fee simple, except under certain circumstances (38 CFR 
36.4350(a)) 
 title must to be subject to unreasonable restrictions o use and occupancy, except under 
certain circumstances (38 CFR 36.4350(b)), and 
 certain minor title limitations will not be considered by VA, to the extent described, as 
materially affecting the value of the property 
 (38 CFR 36.4350 (c)).

[38 CFR 36.4350 (a)] 
[38 CFR 36.4350 (b)]

Superior VA  VA regulations require that every VA loan be secured by a first lien on the property, except 
Lien  under certain circumstances.  (38 CFR 36.4351 and 38 CFR 36.4352) 
 
When a property is located in a condominium or planned unit development, the lender must 
ensure that any mandatory homeowner association assessment is subordinate to the VA-
guaranteed mortgage.

How to  HUD/USDA Approval 
Expedite VA  Generally, projects already approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
Approval  (HUD) or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) do not need further VA 
review.  Upon receipt of evidence of HUD/USDA approval, such as a copy of the 
HUD/USDA approved project list or the project approval letter, the VA office of jurisdiction 
adds the project to the nationwide VA list without issuing a formal VA approval letter. 
 
In rare cases, HUD or USDA may approve a project that VA discovers does not comply with 
VA regulations.  In those cases, VA notifies the lender as soon as practicable that it will not 
guarantee loans in the project. 
 
Use of Attorney’s Opinion 
This is a highly recommended options for condominiums that have not been approved by 
HUD or USDA. 
 
Reference:  See Section 16-B. 
 
Use of Previously Approved Documents 
When the organizational documents being submitted are essentially the same as a set 
previously approved by VA, the lender/sponsor should include a certification from the 
declarant or declarant’s attorney which 
 
 states the fact 
 specifically identifies the previous set, and 
 describes any variation to the previous set. 
 
State Agency Certification of a Condominium 
If a state agency certifies that the condominium has been created in compliance with the laws 
of the state in which it is located, include the certification.

8.  Contains provisions for maintaining the common areas.  If the association maintains areas it does not own (such 
as within a public right-of way for landscaping or signage or storm water management), the attorney must 
provide an explanation which describes the arrangement and discusses the rationale.

Exhibit A:  Other VA Requirements, 
Continued 
  
(A)  Declaration (continued) 
 
9.  Contains provisions for the adoption of an annual operating budget and imposition and collection of 
assessments to meet the expenses of the association.  The board of directors has the power on behalf of the 
association to levy both annual and additional assessments.  
 
a.  Units of a similar nature, receiving similar services, are assessed on a uniform basis except for the reduced 
assessment permitted for unoccupied units owned by the declarant or a builder.  If a different basis is used 
which allocates assessment liability among unit based on different services provided to the units or the different 
nature of the units, the rationale for that basis must be fully explained. 
 
b.  If the declarant furnishes a multi-year feasibility budget, the declarant and/or a builder may pay a reduced 
annual assessment on unoccupied lots only provided that such reduced assessment is not less than 25% of the 
full annual assessment.  Alternatively, the declarant or builder may pay a one-time assessment equal to 25 
percent of the applicable annual assessment per lot based upon the first year budget at maximum build-out (or 5 
years out for projects involving 250 or more lots/units).  The lots for which the one-time assessment has been 
paid may be exempt from further assessment until the earlier of: (i) initial occupancy or (ii) two fiscal years 
after submission to the declaration.  If unoccupied units are receiving the benefit of the reduced or one-time 
assessment, the documents provide that the declarant, or builder(s) as appropriate, must provide for or pay for 
all maintenance to such units and shall fund all operating budget deficits incurred during the declarant control 
period, including reserves based upon expected lives of items for which reserved, but not including shortfalls 
caused by nonpayment of assessments by other members or extraordinary expenditures (e.g., expenses caused 
by natural catastrophes or environmental hazards).  A unit initially occupied or conveyed to a unit owner other 
than the declarant or a builder is fully assessed.  The obligation to fund budget deficits is a lien against all the 
land owned by the declarant (or the declarant and builders) in the planned unit development.

10. If a maximum annual assessment is stated, the maximum may increase automatically by the greater of ten 
percent or based upon a Consumer Price Index, such as the U.S. Department of Urban Price Index - All Urban 
Consumers (1982-84=100) or other comparable index reflecting the association’s cost increase experience each 
year.  The maximum may also be increased by a majority vote of the members obligated to pay such assessment 
or with the written approval of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number of authorized votes of 
members obligated to pay such assessment (in both cases excluding the declarant during the declarant control 
period).  Increases in certain fixed costs for insurance, taxes, recycling or waste disposal may be passed through 
to the members, by permitting an automatic increase in the maximum assessment which reflects those increases.  
If no maximum assessment is set forth, a vote of the members must be required to approve capital expenditures, 
other than for repair and replacement, during a fiscal year of more than 20 percent of the budget for common 
expenses for that fiscal year. 
 
11. Contains provisions for a lien-supported assessment.  The assessment lien of any assessment levied by the 
association is subordinate to the lien of a first mortgage (Title 38, USC, section 3703(d)(3)).  Subordination to 
other security interests or liens is acceptable if permitted by applicable law.  The sale or transfer of any unit 
pursuant to mortgage foreclosure of a first mortgage or any proceeding in lieu thereof extinguishes the lien of 
such assessments as to payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer.  No sale or transfer relieves 
such unit from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.  (NOTE: VA will 
not recognize any limited priority that common expense assessments may have over the first mortgage lien.  
Mortgage holders should be aware that no VA claim payment will be made to holders for any payments they 
may have made to clear prior liens for delinquent and unpaid association assessments).

12. Contains provisions for collection of assessments.  The interest rate permitted to be charged by the association 
is uniform, reasonable and non-usurious.  The method of determining the interest rate is set forth.  A rate not to 
exceed that charged by the Internal Revenue Service on delinquent taxes is considered reasonable.  The 
association has the power both to foreclose the association's lien and to bring a legal action against the member 
personally obligated to pay the assessment.  The documents may provide that a successor in title is entitled to 
obtain an association disclosure statement or estoppel certificate with respect to common expense assessments, 
in which case an owner's personal obligation to pay assessments is assumed by successors in title unless the 
successor in title acquired title through foreclosure, or any proceeding in lieu thereof, of a first mortgage.  
(NOTE: Units which will be subject to a VA-guaranteed loan will not be subject to delinquent assessments in 
excess of 6 months in any case in which the association has not brought enforcement action against the current 
unit owner.) 
 
13. Contains provisions for enforcement of the association documents.  If owners are held liable for costs and 
expenses incurred by the association as a result of acts or omissions of such owner or such owner’s tenants, 
agents, employees, invitees, guests and household members in failing to comply with the association documents 
or rules or regulations of the association, regardless of negligence or culpability,  then the Public Offering 
Statement and or Information Brochure must describe this matter. 
 
14. Contains provisions requiring appropriate types of insurance.  The board of directors, on behalf of the 
association, has the authority to and is required to obtain coverages in the areas of property damage, liability, 
and personnel.  Owners may be required to maintain certain types of insurance coverages and, if the owner fails 
to purchase that insurance, the board may obtain those coverages at the owner’s expense.  All hazard and flood 
insurance policies which include any units, must also have the standard mortgagee clause and provide for notice 
to the mortgagee at least ten days before lapse, material modification or cancellation of the policy. 
 
15. Contains provisions for reconstruction of the common areas after condemnation or casualty loss.

the common areas: (i) the association documents must:  (a) permanently assign a parking space on the common 
area to each unit; (b) assign a specific parking area to a specific group of units or (c) make other provisions 
assuring parking in compliance with local ordinances; or (ii) the declarant must provide other evidence of 
parking in compliance with local ordinances. 
 
17. Contains provisions guaranteeing mortgagees (may be limited to eligible mortgagees, as defined below) and 
agencies notice of amendments.  During the declarant control period: (i) the declarant must provide a copy of all 
amendments to VA; and (ii) the association may not make any material amendments or take any extraordinary 
actions as described in subparagraph 6 above without the approval of VA.  The declaration may provide that 
certain rights and protections (including notice and approval rights) are granted to only those mortgagees who 
have provided notice to the board of directors of their interest and requested all rights under the association 
documents “eligible mortgagees.”  Rights granted to eligible mortgagees should include the following: 
 
a.  Right to inspect association documents and records on the same terms as the members; 
 
b.  Notice of all material amendments to the association documents; 
 
c.  Notice of any extraordinary actions of the association; 
 
d.  Notice of any property loss, condemnation or eminent domain proceeding affecting the common areas 
resulting in losses greater than 10 percent of the annual budget or any unit insured by the association in which 
the mortgagee has an interest; 
 
e.  Notice of any termination, lapse or material modification of an insurance policy held by the association; 
 
f.  Notice of any default by an owner of a unit subject to a mortgage held by the eligible mortgagee in paying 
assessments or charges to the association which remains uncured for sixty consecutive days;

the jurisdiction must provide for the maintenance, repair and reconstruction of party walls and allocate the costs 
among the owners served by a party wall. 
 
19. Contains provisions for expansion or annexation in a phased development.  The declaration must, in addition to 
submitting at least 1 phase to the covenants and restrictions: (i) describe the additional land proposed to be 
submitted in the future in a sufficient manner to locate the property; (ii) grant the declarant the right to submit 
the described additional land; (iii) describe the method of submitting additional land; d describe the basis of 
voting rights and assessment obligations of units added in relation to the voting rights and assessment 
obligations of units already subject to the declaration or provide that such rights for future phases will be the 
same as for phases already submitted; and establish a reasonable time limit for submitting additional land.  A 
reasonable time limit will depend on the size of the development, but generally annexation made within the later 
of 7 years after recordation of the Declaration or 5 years after the most recent recordation of an annexation 
document is considered reasonable.  The additional land must be contiguous, adjacent or across a public right-
of-way.  If the additional land is not so located, there must be a clear statement of that fact and a discussion of 
the rationale for its potential inclusion.  The declaration may reserve the right to the declarant to submit a 
limited amount of undescribed adjacent additional land, increasing the total size of the planned community by 
up to 10 percent both in land size and number of additional units, or such undescribed additional land may be 
added by the association with a majority vote of the members at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is 
present or the written consent of members entitled to cast a majority of the total number of votes, in both cases 
excluding the votes of the declarant during the declarant control period.

VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised    Chapter 17:  VA Sanctions Against Program Participants 
Chapter 17 
VA Sanctions Against Program Participants 
Overview 
 
Introduction  VA is authorized to impose sanctions against persons or entities who take 
actions which are detrimental to the VA loan guaranty program.  The type and 
severity of the sanction imposed is based on 
 
 the type of participant (for example, lender, builder, management broker, 
etc.), and 
 the nature of the actions (for example., fraud, significant deficiencies in 
performance, ongoing disregard for VA requirements, and so on). 
 
Sanctions may be imposed in the form of 
 
 civil money penalties, and/or 
 the participant’s full or partial exclusion from participation in the VA loan 
guaranty program for a certain period of time. 
 
Appeal Rights  VA provides appeal rights to all program participants against whom sanctions 
are imposed.  The notice informing the participant that sanctions will be or 
are imposed explains what the participant must do to appeal VA’s decision. 
 
In this Chapter  This chapter contains the following topics.

Example:  limiting a seller’s liability to the refund of the earnest money 
deposit 
 
 advertising that a property or project is “VA guaranteed” or “VA approved” 
or “VA inspected” in such a way as to lead veterans to believe that VA 
guarantees the construction and workmanship 
Note:  “VA financing available,” “Eligible for VA financing,” or similar 
advertising is acceptable. 
 
 delaying tactics on the part of the builder to postpone completion of the 
property or the closing of the sale after completion in an effort to induce the 
veteran to agree to a modification of a firm contract such as 
 the substitution of inferior materials 
 the omission of appliances, or 
 an increase in price. 
 
 failure of the seller or agent of the seller of proposed or newly constructed 
property to place deposits or downpayments received from veteran-
purchasers in a special trust account , as required by 38 U.S.C. 3706

requirements (see section 3 of this chapter), their SAPP authority may be used 
for eligible properties (those secured by VA-guaranteed loans) in any location 
within the United States and its territories.  The purpose of SAPP is to reduce 
the time required for servicers of VA loans to receive the NOV.  
 
Important:  It is the SAR’s responsibility to stay informed about any local 
VA processing requirements unique to the VA jurisdiction in which a 
property is located. 
 
b. Servicer  To be granted SAPP authority, the servicer must have:  
Eligibility   
Requirements 
 a VA servicer identification number (ID), 
 an association with a single lender having a VA lender ID, and 
 an effective quality control (QC) system that ensures the adequacy and 
quality of its SARs.  (See section 6 of this chapter.) 
 
Note:  Under SAPP, a servicer may only have an association with a single 
lender. 
 
c. SAR  The servicer exercises its SAPP authority through an employee who is a VA-
Eligibility  approved SAR.  A SAR must: 
Requirements   
 be a full-time salaried employee of the lender/servicer, and  
 have at least three years of work experience that qualifies him or her to 
competently perform administrative appraisal reviews.

1.  Purpose and Eligibility Requirements, 
Continued 
  
c. SAR  The SAR’s work experience must indicate that he or she has: 
Eligibility   
Requirements 
 general knowledge of the principles, methods, practices, and techniques of 
(continued) 
appraising and the ability to apply that knowledge, 
 the ability to review the work of others and recognize deviations from 
accepted appraisal principles and practices, 
 the ability to detect errors in computations, and 
 the ability to detect conclusions that are not supported. 
 
It is also desirable for the SAR to have knowledge of general realty practices 
and principles related to real property valuation, skill in collecting and 
assembling data, and the ability to prepare clear and concise reports. 
 
Note:  Three years experience related to the Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) Direct Endorsement (DE) program satisfies the experience 
requirement, provided all other application requirements are satisfied. 
 
d. SAR  There must be no conflict of interest between the SAR’s role and any other 
Conflicts of  activities that he or she conducts.  Examples of other activities that would 
Interest  constitute a conflict of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 
 the SAR being on the VA fee appraisal panel, or 
 the SAR being employed by or performing appraisal review services for 
another lender/servicer.

2.  Applying for Authority 
  
a. Application  The nominating senior officer of the servicer and the nominee must jointly 
and Fees  complete the Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR) application. 
 
SAR applicants must attach a resume showing they possess the three years 
requisite experience outlined in section 1 of this chapter. 
 
A $100 processing fee must accompany the application package.   
  
b. Notification  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Central Office will review the 
of VA Decision  application and send a letter of preliminary approval or rejection.  In some 
cases, VA will need to request additional information from both the nominee 
and the senior officer in order to make a determination. 
 
Receipt of a letter of preliminary approval will authorize the nominee to 
schedule Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SAR training.  
  
c. SAR ID  VA will issue a permanent identification (ID) number for each SAR 
Number  approved.  The SAR always retains the same ID number, even when 
employed by a different servicer.   
 
When a SAR already has a Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) 
SAR ID number, the number will also be used as the SAPP SAR ID. 
 
d. SAR  If a SAR begins work for a new servicer, the SAR’s SAPP authority 
Employed By  automatically ceases and does not transfer to the new servicer.  To reinstate 
New Servicer  the SAR’s SAPP authority, the new servicer employer must promptly submit 
to VA: 
 
 a new SAPP application, and 
 a $100 processing fee. 
 
The servicer may request a waiver for the training and case review 
requirements for that SAR by including: 
 
 the SAR’s VA-issued ID number on the application, and  
 a statement that the SAR has processed SAPP cases within the last year.

3.  Training and Initial Test Case Reviews   
  
a. Requirements  Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SARs) with preliminary approval may not 
independently review liquidation appraisal reports and issue liquidation 
Notice of Values (NOVs), without the involvement of Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA), until they receive final approval.  To obtain final 
approval, the SAR must complete the following: 
 
 attend Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) SAR training, and  
 successfully complete five initial test cases to demonstrate comprehension 
of VA liquidation appraisal review requirements to VA’s satisfaction. 
 
VA Central Office staff will provide SAPP SAR training at the request of the 
servicer and VA Regional Loan Center (RLC) staff will conduct the initial 
test case reviews.   
 
b. Test Case  Upon completion of SAR training, SARs may begin submitting their test 
Procedures  cases in The Appraisal System (TAS) for VA review.  Only one test case 
should be pending at any time; SARs should not submit an additional test 
case until the results of a previously submitted test case are known.  RLC 
staff will notify the SAR about the results of the review.  The RLC staff 
performing the review of test cases must complete the liquidation appraisal 
review and issue the NOV within five workdays from the date the case is 
submitted by the SAR.   
 
The following table outlines the steps for processing SAPP SAR test cases.  
Please note that these are the same steps for processing any SAPP cases, 
except for the requirement of VA involvement. 
 
Step  Description 
1  SAR accesses the VA E-Appraisal application in the Veterans 
Information Portal (VIP or Portal) and retrieves a SAPP appraisal.  
(Only SAPP appraisals associated with the SAR’s company may 
be retrieved.) 
2  SAR reviews the appraisal report for completeness and conformity 
with industry-accepted appraisal practices and techniques, and for 
compliance with applicable VA directives and general and 
liquidation appraisal requirements in chapter 11. 
 
The SAR must resolve any concerns with the appraiser. (Report 
any contact with the appraiser and the results in “Processing 
Notes” when issuing the NOV.)

b. Test Case Procedures (continued) 
  
Step  Description 
3  SAR determines the as-is value of the property, which must be 
supported by the reviewed appraisal report. (Make entries in 
“Processing Notes” to clarify or justify actions that are not self-
explanatory.) 
4  SAR accesses TAS in VIP, selects “Issue Liquidation NOV,” and 
inputs the required data to generate an NOV.  (TAS will not allow 
SARs with preliminary approval to issue NOVs; they may only be 
saved as NOV test cases awaiting review by the RLC.  (Upon 
receipt of SAR final approval, TAS will allow issuance of the 
NOV without VA involvement.) 
 
Note: The SAR must notify the RLC of jurisdiction when a test 
case has been submitted in TAS. 
5  VA RLC staff will review the following for all test cases and a 
percentage of subsequent cases:  
 
 appraisal report, 
 any related documents, 
 the saved test case NOV, and  
 processing notes, for any contacts with the appraiser, processing 
delays and clarification and/or justification of processing actions.  
6  VA staff will issue the NOV.  The SAR will be notified of the 
result(s) of the VA test case review and the SAR’s performance 
file will be documented. 
 
c. Continuing  As needed, VA will notify SAPP SARs of supplemental training 
Education by  opportunities or additional training requirements.

4.  Servicer Responsibilities 
  
a. SAPP  Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) authority is a privilege 
Privilege  delegated to servicers at VA’s discretion.  Servicers maintain this privilege by 
complying with all applicable SAPP-related requirements, including: 
 
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policies and procedures, 
 VA regulations, and 
 statutory requirements. 
 
Furthermore, servicers are expected to exercise due diligence in processing 
SAPP cases.  VA considers due diligence to be care that is properly expected 
from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent servicer that is 
entirely dependent on the subject property as a security to protect its 
investment.  
 
If VA finds proper cause, the privilege extended to servicers under SAPP may 
be: 
 
 amended, 
 suspended, or 
 withdrawn. 
 
Reference:  For more information, refer to chapter 17. 
 
b. Servicer and  The servicer must notify VA Central Office if: 
SAR Changes   
 there is a change in ownership, merger, or acquisition, or 
 a SAR is no longer employed or is no longer functioning as a SAR for the 
servicer.  (In such cases, the SAR’s SAPP authority automatically ceases 
and the servicer’s eligibility to participate in SAPP is terminated if that 
individual was the servicer’s only SAR on staff.)

5.  Processing Procedures 
 
a. Property  The subject property must be secured by a Department of Veterans Affairs 
Eligibility  (VA) guaranteed loan that is proceeding toward liquidation. 
 
b. Appraisal  Servicers will request the appraisal in The Appraisal System (TAS) by 
Request  completing VA Form 26-1805, VA Request for Determination of Reasonable 
Value.  TAS will automatically notify the assigned appraiser via e-mail when 
the liquidation appraisal assignment is made.   
 
Servicers may authorize parties to order appraisals on their behalf (i.e., law 
firms).  Those parties must register in the Veterans Information Portal (VIP) 
under their own name as an “Other Requestor.” 
If the agent…  Then…

Program (SAPP) servicer and is 
authorized by that servicer, 
requests an appraisal,  he or she must use his or her own 
log-in identification (ID) to request 
appraisals.  An appraisal cannot be 
requested unless the sponsoring 
servicer is known at the time of the 
request. 
 
Note:  In requesting an appraisal, the

required certifications on behalf of

Note:  When making the request, be sure to provide accurate information on 
the location of the keys to a vacant property in item 24 of VA Form 26-1805, 
VA Request for Determination of Reasonable Value, as well as the telephone 
number of the party requesting the liquidation appraisal in item 40.  This may 
require additional instructions from servicers when referring cases to 
foreclosing attorneys, if the attorneys are the parties ordering the liquidation 
appraisals.

Continued 
 
c. Access to  VA requires fee appraisers to gain access to vacant properties when 
Property by  performing VA liquidation appraisals in order to determine accurate values.  
Appraiser  If the fee appraiser is unable to gain access to a vacant property, the appraiser 
should use the contact information provided in item 40 of VA Form 26-1805, 
VA Request for Determination of Reasonable Value.  Servicers’ timely 
responses to any telephone inquiries help to limit delays in completion of 
appraisals for those cases where an appraiser encounters problems accessing 
the vacant property. 
 
If the appraiser still cannot gain access, he or she must document the actions 
taken to obtain access to the subject vacant property in an e-mail to the 
Construction & Valuation (C&V) section of jurisdiction.  C&V will then 
forward the appraiser’s email to the Regional Loan Center’s Loan 
Administration Officer, who will forward it to the appropriate servicer 
personnel.   
 
Time delays caused by an appraiser’s inability to access a property can result 
in postponed liquidation sales.  Because such delays are beyond the control of 
the appraiser, C&V “stops the clock” on the appraiser’s timeliness 
requirements until access is obtained.  However, in most cases, VA does not 
view delays as beyond the control of the servicer, and therefore the servicer 
may suffer curtailment of interest on the loan if a sale cannot be completed 
timely due to delays in the appraiser obtaining access to a property. 
 
d. Liquidation  For details about VA liquidation appraisal requirements, see section 13 of 
Appraisal  chapter 11. 
Requirements 
 
e. Submitting  If a SAR is reluctant to issue the Notice of Value (NOV) due to the difficulty 
Cases to VA for  or complexity of the case, the SAR may request that the VA Regional Loan 
Processing  Center (RLC) of jurisdiction issue the NOV.

and Scope of  The sample size should be no less than: 
Reviews   
 five percent of the SAR’s SAPP cases processed monthly, or 
 a minimum number of cases per month (for example, five cases). 
 
There must be a procedure for expanding the scope of the reviews if a pattern 
of deficiencies is identified. 
 
d. QC Review  QC reviews should consider: 
Criteria   
 the overall quality of the SAR’s appraisal review, and 
 the appropriateness of the reasonable value determination. 
  
e. Maintenance  The QC system must provide assurance that all current VA regulations, 
of VA  directives, and other releases are maintained and immediately available to the
