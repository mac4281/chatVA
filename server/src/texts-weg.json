The power factor is\n\ndetermined by measuring the input power, voltage and, rated\n\nload current.\n\nPower factor correction\n\nThe increase of power factor is made by the connection of\n\na capacitive load, in general, a capacitor or a synchronous\n\nmotor with overexcitation, in parallel with the load.\n\nFor example:\n\nA three-phase electric motor, 100 HP ( 75 kW ), IV poles,\n\nrunning at 100% of the rated power, with an original power\n\nfactor of 0.87 and efficiency of 93.5%. Now a reactive power\n\nshould be determined to raise the power factor to 0.95.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing the table 1.2, on the intersection of 0.87 line with the\n\ncolumn of 0.95, we get the value 0.238 that multiplied by the\n\nmotor absorbed power from the line in kW, gives the amount\n\nof reactive power necessary to increase the power factor\n\nfrom 0.87 to 0.95.\n\nkVAr   =   P (HP) x 0.7457 x F x 100%\n\nEff. %', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': '/content/WEG-motors-specification-of-electric-motors-50039409-brochure-english-web.pdf'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='= 100 x 0.7457 x 0.238 x 100%\n\n93.5%\n\nkVAr =18.981 kVAr\n\nWhere: kVAr = Three-phase power of the capacitor bank to be installed\n\nP (HP) = Motor rated output\n\nF = Factor obtained in the Table 1.2\n\nEff. % = Motor efficiency\n\nFigure 1.4 - The Power factor is determined measuring the input power, the\n\nvoltage and the rated load\n\nPower factor importance\n\nReactive energy limits useful (active) energy carrying capacity\n\nin the transmission, sub-transmission, and distribution, in\n\nother words, the higher the power factor, the greater the\n\navailability of active power in the system and greater is the\n\nuse of the electrical system.\n\nThe electric motor plays a very important role in the\n\nindustry since it represents more than 68% of the energy\n\nconsumption. Therefore, it is essential to apply motors with\n\noutputs and features well adapted to its function since the\n\npower factor changes with motor load.\n\n9\n\nSpecification of Electric Motors

In most cases\n\nthe values even exceed the minimum requirements of Design H.\n\nThis means a very high speed-torque curve, bringing the following\n\nbenefits:\n\n1 )  Quick acceleration under heavy starting conditions, e.g.\n\nfor piston pumps, loaded conveyors, high inertia loads,\n\ncompressors with open valves, etc.\n\n2 )  Quick responsiveness for special supplies such as those\n\nmentioned since standard motors are always readily\n\navailable from stock, with price benefits and quick\n\ndelivery.\n\n3 )  The possibility of using reduced voltage starting methods,\n\ne.g. Star-Delta Starters, in normal cases, without affecting\n\nperfect load acceleration.\n\n4 )  Due to the high value of the breakdown torque,\n\nmomentary load peaks and temporary voltage drops', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': '/content/WEG-motors-specification-of-electric-motors-50039409-brochure-english-web.pdf'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='are accepted without any sudden speed loss. This is a\n\nfundamental requirement for the performance of machines\n\nthat are subjected to heavy load peaks, such as crushers,\n\ncalender machines, etc.\n\n4.2 Load Inertia\n\nThe driven load inertia is one of the most important\n\ncharacteristics to be checked during the acceleration time\n\nto ensure that the motor will be able to drive the load within\n\nthe ambient requirements or the thermal capabilities of the\n\ninsulation materials.\n\nInertia is the way how we measure the resistance of an\n\nobject to change its rotation movement around a shaft. It also\n\ndepends on the shaft around which it is rotating, the shape of\n\nthe object and the way its mass is distributed.

When squirrel cage induction motors are\n\nfed by frequency, those pulses combined with the cable\n\nand motor impedance may cause repetitive overvoltages\n\n(overshoots) at the motor terminals. This pulse train may\n\ndegrade the motor insulation system and may hence reduce\n\nthe motor lifetime. The overshoots affect especially the inter\n\nturn isolation of random winding and its value is determined\n\nprimarily by following factors: rise time of the voltage pulse,\n\ncable length and type, minimum time between pulses,\n\nswitching frequency and multi motor operation.\n\n61\n\nSpecification of Electric Motors     www.weg.net\n\nCriteria regarding the insulation system', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': '/content/WEG-motors-specification-of-electric-motors-50039409-brochure-english-web.pdf'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='When WEG low voltage induction motors are used with\n\nfrequency inverters, the following criteria must be met to\n\nprotect the insulation system of the motor:  if any of the\n\nconditions below are not met, filters must be installed\n\nbetween the frequency inverter and the motor.\n\nNote:  motors rated for explosive atmospheres should be evaluated on a case\n\nby case basis  - in such case please contact WEG.\n\nMotor rated voltage\n\nVoltage spikes at\n\nmotor terminals\n\n( phase-phase )\n\ndV/dt* at motor\n\nterminals\n\n( phase-phase )\n\nRise\n\nTime*\n\nMTBP\n\nVNOM < 460 V\n\n460 V < VNOM < 575 V\n\n575 V < VNOM < 1000 V\n\n< 1600 V\n\n< 2000 V\n\n< 2400 V\n\n< 5200 V/µs\n\n< 6500 V/µs\n\n> 0.1 µs\n\n> 6 µs\n\n< 7800 V/µs\n\nTable 11.4\n\nDefinition in accordance with NEMA MG1- Part 30\n\nThe electric potential of the rotor may then increase with\n\nrespect to the earth until the dielectric strength of the grease\n\nfilm is disrupted, occurring voltage sparking and flow of\n\ndischarge current through the bearings.
