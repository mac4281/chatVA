DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The top non-residential taxpayers are those who own commercial property and are looking to sell. The asking price for these properties ranges from $.80 to $25 per square foot, with the closer to the intersection of FM 528 and FM 518, the higher the asking price. The types of prospective buyers and end users that have expressed the most interest in purchasing these properties are residential, retirement communities, and religious assemblies. The property owners unanimously agree with the strategy, but have given numerous opinions about why they believe the strategy will not be adhered to, including that the city has a reputation of residential neighborhoods fighting commercial development, that City Council caves in to residential neighbors who object to commercial development, and that the city has negative stigma as not being developer friendly.
