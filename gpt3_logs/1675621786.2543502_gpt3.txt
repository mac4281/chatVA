The area that represents Friendswood's greatest economic potential is the Panhandle. This area is rich in resources and has the potential to attract businesses in the target industries of professional office, healthcare, retail, commercial, and light industrial. The CEDC will continue to promote the Live Here Work Here program to cultivate business expansions and start-ups in the community and will require a fiscal impact analysis on downzoning property and a formal process for the CEDC to have input to Planning and Zoning and City Council on all commercial rezoning requests.  The most important issue facing Friendswood today, according to the 2013 citizen survey, is diversifying the tax base. The city's residents want to see continued diversification of the city's property tax base and see more commercial enterprises establishing within the city. Eighty-eight percent of respondents feel that the city should work to attract businesses to Friendswood. The top three answers for what type of commercial development residents would like to see locate in Friendswood were restaurants (38%), retail shopping (21%), and hotels (12%).  The area that represents Friendswood's greatest economic potential is the FM 528 corridor. This corridor provides more opportunities for future commercial development, particularly for retail businesses, than any other place in the city. Retail businesses preferred location is usually influenced by high traffic areas, corner sites, pedestrian foot traffic, neighboring retailers nearby, and community demographics. FM 528 is linked to I-45 with great visibility and physical attributes of being a seven-lane road that carries more than 31,000 cars per day. There are large commercial tracts available along the corridor. That being said, there is a strong demand for one to five-acre tracts along FM 528 at FM 518 that are not available.  The FM 528 Business Corridor represents Friendswood's greatest commercial potential to diversify its residential-heavy property tax base. It has been quite evident that the free-market has made the area the target designation for commercial development. Due to the highest traffic counts within the city, commercial developers and retail merchants want to locate along the FM 528 corridor.  Based on the passage, it appears that Friendswood's greatest economic potential lies in commercial development, specifically in attracting businesses such as restaurants, retail stores, hotels, and small independent businesses. The city can offer incentives to developers such as reimbursement agreements and tax rebates in order to attract new commercial development.

The greatest economic potential for Friendswood lies in its commercial development. This is evident from the city's Vision 2020, which sets a goal of 80% residential and 20% commercial development. While residential growth has been easy, commercial growth has proven more challenging due to competing localities that are more conducive to commercial development, primarily the I-45 retail corridor. With real estate corridors for commercial development limited, city officials have established key commercial zones along prime traffic corridors that would allow the city just enough prime real estate to reach its 80/20 (residential/commercial) goal. In addition, targeted businesses SIC/NAICS codes were identified that best fit in the community. The CEDC recommends the City launch a public awareness campaign to help communicate the FM 528 Strategy and the overall importance to diversify the tax base. A uniform message is needed that delivers a pro development image to attract commercial developers and brokers to the city. This can be done via the Public, Educational, and Governmental Access channel, website, and social media. Special ads and op ed pieces can be written and distributed to the local media. Packets of the final report should be made available to HOAs, landowners, developers, retailers, and local organizations such as the Friendswood Chamber and Rotary.

The most common answer from the passage was that the city needs to send prospective buyers and improve infrastructure in order to help with the development potential in Friendswood. The city committees and boards also noted that they would like to be kept informed of any recommendations, implementation, and progress that is made in regards to the strategy.  The passage suggests that Friendswood's greatest economic potential lies in commercial and retail development, as these generate property, sales, and inventory taxes. Residential developments generate property tax, but with a 20% homestead exemption. Nonprofit organizations and tax-exempt entities generate no tax.

Furthermore, tax-exempt development typically deters neighboring property from retail and commercial development as parking, alcohol, and other restrictions make development more problematic.
