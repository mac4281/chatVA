PASSAGE: land and homes.

While residential growth has been easy, commercial growth has  In any community, residents consume more city services than the taxes that they pay.   This is typically offset by taxes collected from businesses and industries, who pay more in  taxes than they consume."  Vision 2020  proven  more  challenging  due  to  competing  localities  that  are  more  conducive  to  commercial    development, primarily the I-45 retail corridor.  With real estate corridors for commercial development  limited, city officials have established key commercial zones along prime traffic corridors that would  allow the city just enough prime real estate to reach its 80/20 (residential/commercial) goal.   In  addition, targeted businesses SIC/NAICS codes were identified that best fit in the community.  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Community & Economic Development Committee 2        NEW PAGE  IMPLEMENTATION  The FM 528 corridor will be the Citys primary development focus with a sense of urgency    established around three primary objectives:   1) Promotion, 2) Protection, and 3)  Development.      1) Promotion  Targeted marketing, awareness and incentive programs will be prioritized with t he  primary focus on the FM 528 commercially zoned properties.  Close relationships with property owners  and developers will be established with a goal to work together to promote and secure commercial  opp ortunities.  2) Protection  Raise awareness and deter downzoning of valuable commercially zoned properties that  may cause the city to raise taxes in the future due to its loss of valuable commercial property.  Provide  an eye of caution to city officials, residents, developers and special interest groups that threaten future  city revenues when non-commercial development applications are put forth requesting zone changes.     3)  Development    Work  closely  with  all  parties  that  when  financial  resources  become  available,  preferential consideration is given for infrastructure improvement, beautification, and attracting desired  development.  COMMUNICATION  During  the  meetings  with  landowners  and  potential  commercial  developers,  they  expressed  hearing mixed messages regarding whether the city desires commercial development.  This can  partially be attributed to the predominance and continued demand for residential development  in the community  developers believe the city wants and needs more of the same.  Overall, a  resolution of commitment for economic development and the FM 528 Strategy will help initiate a  communication strategy in moving forward.    The CEDC recommends the City launch a public awareness campaign to help communicate the  FM 528 Strategy and the overall importance to diversify the tax base.  A uniform message is  needed that delivers a pro development image to attract commercial developers and brokers to  the  city.    This  can  be  done  via  the  Public,  Educational,  and Governmental  Access channel,  website, and social media.  Special ads and op ed pieces can be written and distributed to the  local  media.    Packets  of  the  final  report  should  be  made  available  to  HOAs,  landowners,  developers, retailers, and local organizations such as the Friendswood Chamber and Rotary.   Board and committees also expressed their desire to stay informed as well as Friendswood  residents.  A video of the Mayor with a pro development message can be produced and accessed  on the Citys website.      PROPERTY OWNERS INPUT  There are currently 71 separate lots that total 1,348 acres of undeveloped commercial property abutting  FM 528 within the city limits of Friendswood, with an assessed value of $22 million.

RESPONSE:

There is no specific mention of permit fees associated with alarms in the passage. However, based on the information provided, it is safe to assume that there would be some fees associated with alarm permits in Friendswood. These fees could potentially be used to offset the costs of city services consumed by residents.
