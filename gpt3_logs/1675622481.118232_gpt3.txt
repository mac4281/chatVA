PASSAGE: or pressing job matters. Volunteers should work with supervisors to ensure the volunteer  gets the information they need for their assignment.   6.3  INTERFERING WITH CITY OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES  In accordance with Chapter 54 of the Citys Code of Ordinance, volunteers are strictly  prohibited from interfering with an officer or City employee during the performance of their  official  duties.  Doing  so  may  result  in  disciplinary  action  and/or  termination  of  their  volunteer status.   12 | P a ge     NEW PAGE  6.4  HOURS OF SERVICE  Volunteers are not required to work a certain number of hours or be on duty at specific  times; this is the very nature of volunteering. However, volunteers should be aware that if  they commit to being at a volunteer assignment and dont show up, or leave early, they may  hamper the overall effort. In cases of volunteers being repeatedly unreliable in showing up  for assignments, leaving posts unattended or not completing work they have previously  accepted, the City or the supervising organization may elect to change the volunteers  assignment or limit the participation of that volunteer.   6.5  FINANCIAL LIABILITIES OR REPRESENTING THE CITY EXTERNALLY  No volunteer or volunteer group has authority to bind the City of Friendswood into any  financial liability or agreement. In situations involving volunteers that could end up with a  financial liability to the City, the volunteer or volunteer group must have approval and clear  written authority from the City.   Volunteers are not allowed to conduct City business with external parties such as vendors,  suppliers,  other  volunteer  groups,  school  districts,  other  municipalities  or  professional  services (doctors, lawyers, veterinarians, engineering firms, etc.) on behalf of the City or  organization unless given specific instructions by the supervising City staff. When in doubt  on this matter, volunteers should ask before acting.  If given permission to conduct business with external parties, volunteers must be aware that  their behavior may reflect on the City in different areas from the one in which they are  directly involved. For example, a supplier may deal with a volunteer in one area and provide  services to the City in other areas. Therefore, volunteers who have permission to conduct  business with external parties must always be professional and courteous and refrain from  arguments,  demanding  language,  threats,  empty  promises  or  unacceptable  business  communications.   6.6  MISUSE OF CITY EQUIPMENT OR VEHICLES  Any volunteer found misusing any City equipment or vehicles will be removed from their  volunteer assignment.   6.7  SAFETY AND INJURIES  Volunteers  are  expected  to  use  caution  when  completing  their  volunteer  assignments.  Volunteers are required to immediately report any unsafe conditions to their supervisor.  Volunteers engaging in unsafe actions (such as not wearing protective gear provided to  them) or being reckless face possible administrative action.  Volunteers must report all injuries sustained during their volunteer assignment. There are no  exceptions.  Volunteers  have  limited  coverage  for  on-the-job  injuries  under  the  Citys  Workers Compensation coverage. Any injury, accident, occupational illness or disease that  occurs  during  the  performance  of  volunteer  duties  must  be  reported  to  a  supervisor  13 | P a ge     NEW PAGE  immediately or as soon as possible. The supervisor will provide further instructions for  necessary medical care. If emergency medical services or transport are required, the injury  report must be made as soon thereafter as feasible.  Failing  to  report  an  injury,  accident,  occupational  illness  or  disease  incurred  while  volunteering is considered a serious violation of policy.   6.8  TREATMENT OF OTHERS  All of the items outlined in Section 5, What a Friendswood Volunteer should Expect, are  also  requirements  of  a
