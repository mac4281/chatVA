QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: therefore erred by taking sides on the issue of abortion. II The more difficult question in this case is stare decisis that is, whether to overrule the Roe decision. The principle of stare decisis requires respect for the   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH, J., concurring Courts precedents and for the accumulated wisdom of the judges who have previously addressed the same issue. Stare decisis is rooted in Article III of the Constitution and is fundamental to the American judicial system and to the stability of American law. Adherence to precedent is the norm, and stare decisis imposes a high bar before this Court may overrule a precedent. This Courts history shows, however, that stare decisis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute. Otherwise, as the Court today explains, many long-sinceoverruled cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896); Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905); Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586 (1940); and Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), would never have been overruled and would still be the law. In his canonical Burnet opinion in 1932, Justice Brandeis stated that in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406407 (1932) (dissenting opinion). That description of the Courts practice remains accurate today. Every current Member of this Court has voted to overrule precedent. And over the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Tafts appointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed to this Court has voted to overrule precedent. Many of those Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number of very significant and longstanding precedents. See, e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (overruling Baker v. Nelson); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (overruling Plessy v. Ferguson); West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Adkins v. Childrens Hospital of D. C. and in effect Lochner v. New York). But that history alone does not answer the critical question: When precisely should the Court overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent? The history of stare decisis in   Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7 KAVANAUGH, J., concurring this Court establishes that a constitutional precedent may be overruled only when (i) the prior decision is not just wrong, but is egregiously wrong, (ii) the prior decision has caused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world consequences, and (iii) overruling the prior decision would not unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ______ (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at 78). Applying those factors, I agree with the Court today that Roe should be overruled. The Court in Roe erroneously assigned itself the authority to decide a critically important moral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant this Court the authority to decide. As Justice Byron White succinctly explained, Roe was an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review because nothing in the language or history of the Constitution supports a constitutional right to abortion. Bolton, 410 U. S., at 221222 (dissenting opinion). Of course, the fact that a precedent is wrong, even egregiously wrong, does not alone mean that the precedent should be overruled. But as the Court today explains, Roe has caused significant negative jurisprudential and realworld consequences. By taking sides on a difficult and contentious issue on which the Constitution is neutral, Roe overreached and exceeded this Courts constitutional authority; gravely distorted the Nations understanding of this Courts proper constitutional role; and caused significant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the States important and legitimate


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court considered the principle of stare decisis, which requires respect for the Court's precedents and for the accumulated wisdom of the judges who have previously addressed the same issue. Second, the Court considered the history of stare decisis in this Court, which establishes that a constitutional precedent may be overruled only when it is egregiously wrong, has caused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world consequences, and overruling the precedent would not unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. Third, the Court considered the fact that Roe was an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review because nothing in the language or history of the Constitution supports a constitutional right to abortion. Fourth, the Court considered the negative jurisprudential and real-world consequences of Roe, including the grave distortion of the Nation's understanding of this Court's proper constitutional role.
