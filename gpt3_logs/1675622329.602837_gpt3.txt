DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The top non-residential taxpayers in the city are the commercial developers and retailers who own property along the FM 528 corridor. This corridor is the city's prime commercial real estate, and generates a substantial portion of Friendswood's property and sales tax revenue. These property owners are the most sought-after and likely to be developed, and their development is the city's greatest commercial asset. The goal should be to deter, or minimize, further development along this corridor that does not have the potential for increased city revenue. Additionally, it is recommended that when financial resources become available, preferential consideration be given for infrastructure improvement, beautification, and attracting desired development.
