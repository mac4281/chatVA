RESPONSE:

The top non-residential taxpayers in Friendswood are stores that have been converted from residential to commercial use. These include clothing and clothing accessory stores, sporting goods stores, hobby stores, bookstores, and music stores. Retail studies have shown that there is an unmet demand for these types of stores in Friendswood, and that they can provide a significant source of revenue for the city. However, subprime developments that do not produce revenue at their highest and best use can deter future commercial growth and inhibit the diversification of the city's tax base.
