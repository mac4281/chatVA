QUESTION: How to get a VA loan?


PASSAGE: utilize the following  Underwriting  guidance when underwriting VA-guaranteed loans:  Information      Lenders are encouraged to make VA loans to all qualified Veterans who apply.   VAs underwriting standards are intended to provide guidelines for  underwriters.  Decisions must be based on sound application of the standards,  and underwriters are expected to use good judgment and flexibility in applying  underwriting guidelines.  Not all possible circumstances are addressed  therefore, underwriters must apply reasonable judgment and flexibility in  administering this important Veterans benefit.    b. Basic  By law, VA may only guarantee a loan when it is possible to determine that  Requirements  the Veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, and has present or verified anticipated  income that bears a proper relation to the anticipated terms of repayment.   VAs underwriting standards are incorporated into VA regulations at   38 C.F.R. 36.4340 and explained in this chapter.  This chapter addresses the  procedures for verifications and analysis involved in underwriting a   VA-guaranteed loan.  In the event the lender fails to perform their  responsibilities, VA may take administrative actions including removal of  authority to underwrite and close VA loans.

Lenders  Digital signatures can be accepted as an original signature or wet signature as  Procedures  defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act,  commonly referred to as the E-sign Act.    The procedures below address only the credit underwriting of the loan.    Chapter 5 of this handbook provides all procedures that must be completed  when making a VA loan.      Step  Action  1   Initiate the VA and Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System  (CAIVRS) inquiries described in Topic 4, Subsection c of this   chapter.  2   Obtain all necessary verifications.      The borrowers authorization can be obtained separately for the  lenders required verifications, or on one blanket authorization form.      The Certificate of Eligibility (COE) obtained from WebLGY  provides verification of the amount of the Veterans available  entitlement, verification of exempt/non-exempt from the VA Funding  Fee, and the amount of VA monthly service connected disability  compensation.  Order the COE before ordering the VA appraisal.    The tri-merged credit report and verifications can be ordered by the  lender or its agent or a party designated by the lender to perform that  function.  However, these documents must always be delivered by the  credit reporting agency or verifying party directly to the lender or its  agent, and never to another party.  VA only permits the Veteran to  pay for the credit report invoiced amount, not any additional costs  that the lender may incur through other parties for obtaining the  credit report.
