QUESTION: How does a servicer request an appraisal?


PASSAGE: access, he or she must document the actions  taken to obtain access to the subject vacant property in an e-mail to the  Construction & Valuation (C&V) section of jurisdiction.  C&V will then  forward the appraisers email to the Regional Loan Centers Loan  Administration Officer, who will forward it to the appropriate servicer  personnel.      Time delays caused by an appraisers inability to access a property can result  in postponed liquidation sales.  Because such delays are beyond the control of  the appraiser, C&V stops the clock on the appraisers timeliness  requirements until access is obtained.  However, in most cases, VA does not  view delays as beyond the control of the servicer, and therefore the servicer  may suffer curtailment of interest on the loan if a sale cannot be completed  timely due to delays in the appraiser obtaining access to a property.    d.
