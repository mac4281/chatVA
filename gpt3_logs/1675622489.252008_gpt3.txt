QUESTION: what are the permit fees assiciated with an alarm?


PASSAGE: tracts; and work with commercial developers to  master plan larger tracts so that smaller parcels may be available for end users.  CONCLUSION  The FM 528 Business Corridor represents Friendswoods greatest commercial potential to diversify its  residential-heavy property tax base. It has been quite evident that the free-market has made the area  the target designation for commercial development. Due to the highest traffic counts within the city,  commercial developers and retail merchants want to locate along the FM 528 corridor.       From 1998 to 2007, there was a widening gap between residential and commercial    assessed property values in Friendswood, driven by rapid growth in the assessed    value of residential property and slower growth in commercial property value. The    City of Friendswood now relies much more heavily on residential property values as    a source for tax revenue than in 1998.  Vision 2020 Update, Jason E. Murasko, PhD,      October 3, 2007    Summary of Recommendations      Communication:  The city launches a public awareness campaign to help communicate the FM 528 Strategy and the  overall importance to diversify the tax base.    Property Owners Input:  The city should consider what developments will attract other desired development, what development  will have the opposite effect, and finally have the resolve to adhere to that strategy along the FM 528  Corridor.    Input From City Council, Boards, and Committees:  The City Boards and Committees would like to be kept informed regarding the FM 528 Strategys  recommendations, implementation, and progress.    Prime (Optimum) Development:  The citys main goal should be to deter, or minimize, further development along the FM 528 corridor that  does not have the potential for increased city revenue.    Subprime (Non-Optimum) Developments:  A  policy  should  be  implemented  to  guide  subprime  developments  from  FM  528  to  less  valuable  commercial land within the city.    Tax Exemption:  Preventing or regulating tax exempt development on privately owned real-estate can be extremely  sensitive and challenging, especially property owned by nonprofit organizations. The strategic location of  tax exempt development and forecasting its impact is the responsibility of city leaders.        ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Community & Economic Development Committee 16        NEW PAGE  Recouping Cost of City Services from Tax Exempt Properties:  City should consider negotiating a PILOT program prior to the commencement of future tax exempt  developments, especially if the entity is going to be demanding upon vital services.   Downzoning:  There is no economic benefit for the city to approve zone change requests along the FM 528  Corridor that change the land use from commercial to any type of residential use.  If City Council  determines that a specific type of development would benefit the city, then special consideration  should  be  given  whether  the  project  has  already  been  identified  as  a  strong  need  in  the  community and whether an alternative site could be found to accommodate the use instead of a  highly visible and high traffic corridor (prime commercial real estate).  Resources & Incentives to Attract Commercial Developments:  CEDC recommends that City Council seek CEDCs input and recommendation on the use of special  financing districts, grants, and incentives for any commercial project development proposal or incentive  application.    Infrastructure:  A more concerted effort needs to be put into improving infrastructure on south FM 528 as it is impeding  prime development.    The Future of FM 528  Some proactive steps the city can consider are to proactively rezone properties that are designated as  future commercial use in the Future Land Use Map, provide infrastructure to tracts, and work with  commercial developers to master plan larger tracts so
