Such measures may include verbal or written correction or counseling,  permanent or temporary restriction of volunteer duties, reassignment, permanent removal  from the volunteer assignment and temporary or permanent banning from volunteering for  any City functions.   If the corrective measures taken are administered by City staff or a City supervisor, the  volunteer may appeal the matter to the City Manager.
