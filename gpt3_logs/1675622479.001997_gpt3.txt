QUESTION: what are the permit fees assiciated with an alarm?


PASSAGE: volunteers  behavior  toward  others.  This  includes  bullying,  harassment,  workplace  violence,  ethics  and  tobacco  usage.  This  also  includes  the  interactions a volunteer may have with City employees, contractors, vendors citizens or  other volunteers.   Volunteers should be especially aware of their behavior toward others during their volunteer  hours. Often when volunteering, one may not personally know those with whom they are  working with and vice versa. Therefore, actions or comments that one may feel comfortable  with around friends, such as joking, making sexual or racial references, rough housing,  making political statements, displays of affection, teasing, touching, flirting, etc., are not  appropriate.  In particular, volunteers should be mindful of what can be perceived as physical aggression  or  threatening  behavior.  This  includes  shouting  at  others,  physical  intimidation,  verbal  threats,  throwing  things,  destroying  surroundings  or  brandishing  weapons.  The  City  of  Friendswood has a zero tolerance policy in this area that extends to volunteers as well.   6.9  ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE USE  The pervasive presence of alcohol and substance abuse in our society, the resultant impact  upon the workplace, and the City's obligation to its citizens, require the establishment of a  drug and alcohol free workplace. A volunteer shall not be permitted to report to or remain at  their  assignment  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol,  controlled  substances  or  illegal  drugs/prescription  or medications. Volunteers in an impaired state from any prohibited  substance or alcohol are not allowed on City premises and may not perform any services. A  volunteer shall not possess, sell, ingest, manufacture, hold or transfer illegal drugs, illegal  use of prescribed medication or alcohol while performing any services for the City. A  violation of this policy will result in administrative action up to and including permanent  dismissal as a volunteer of the City.       14 | P a ge     NEW PAGE  6.10  FIREARMS  The  City  of  Friendswoods  facilities  are  governed  by  the  State  of  Texas  regulations  regarding firearms. Firearms are permitted on certain City property only by those holding a  valid Concealed Handgun License (CHL governed under Texas Government Code Section  411.172). The City reserves the right to request documentation from CHL holders if they  carry a weapon during volunteer service. If a volunteer is observed carrying a firearm and  cannot produce a valid CHL, they may be subject to criminal charges and at a minimum;  they will be asked to remove the firearm.  If a City sponsored volunteer event takes place on school district property, State law and  school district regulations apply.   6.11  CONFIDENTIALITY  Although a City is a public entity subject to the Texas Public Information Act, all documents  and property of the City are not public and are not to be copied, released, given, secreted,  or stolen for a volunteers own personal use or purposes or those of a third party. The City  has its own official process and manner by which all public information is identified and  provided to a requester in an orderly and well documented process required by the state. Just  because a volunteer may have access to a document does not mean that the document or a  copy thereof can be provided to anyone, including the volunteer him/herself by any means,  including  telephonic  transmission,  photo,  scanning,  social  media,  etc.  Volunteers  are  responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all facially confidential, private, personal  or privileged information to which they are exposed while serving as a volunteer, whether  this information involves staff, volunteer, citizen or other persons or involves any aspect of  City  business.  A  single  incident  of  failure  to  maintain  confidentiality  may  result  in  termination of the volunteers relationship with the City.

RESPONSE:

The permit fees associated with an alarm vary depending on the type of alarm and the municipality in which it is located. For example, a volunteer may be required to purchase a permit for a smoke alarm, but not for a carbon monoxide alarm. Additionally, the fees for an alarm permit may be different in different cities.
