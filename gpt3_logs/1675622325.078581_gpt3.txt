QUESTION: Who are the top non-residential taxpayers?


PASSAGE: of Friendswood provides equal employment opportunity to all employees and  applicants for employment and volunteers without regard to race, color, religion, gender,  national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era or special  disabled veteran in accordance with applicable federal laws. In addition, the City complies  with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every  location in which the City has facilities. These same ethics and approach apply to the  recruitment and use of volunteers.  2.2  ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY  The  City  does  not  tolerate  sexual  harassment  by  its  employees,  volunteers,  vendors,  contractors or citizens. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, request of  sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Nor does the City  tolerate a hostile working environment based on protected factors. Any volunteer who has  been the victim of such incident should report the incident immediately to the volunteer's  supervisor and/or the City Human Resources Department. Alternatively, any volunteer who  is reported to have violated this policy may have administrative action taken against them  for such violation up to and including permanent removal as a volunteer for the City.   3  HOW THE CITY WORKS   When the burdens of the presidency seem unusually heavy, I always remind myself it  could be worse. I could be a mayor.  President Lyndon Johnson    The City of Friendswood is classified as a  home rule City. This means that the City is  legally  able  to  create  its  own  laws  (ordinances) and conduct its own business,  so long as they do not conflict with State or  federal laws.   City Council and the Mayor determine City  policy and can amend the City Ordinances  and/or create and approve new ordinances.  Council approves the budget and sets the  tax  rate.  It  determines  the  size  of  the  payroll and the extent and cost of municipal services and programs it provides. In short, the  5 | P a ge     NEW PAGE  Council is the final authority on all of the many policy decisions that determine the scope and  functions of the City government. To implement and maintain them, City Council hires the City  Manager. The City Manager has many responsibilities:    Enforcing all City ordinances, rules, and regulations,    Issuing policies and procedures that govern the enforcing of ordinances and regulations,    Supervising all municipal employees and programs,    Preparing and executing the Citys annual budget pursuant to the revenue and expenditure  plans adopted by the Council,     Managing the Citys funds and preparing periodic reports that advise the Council and the  general public of the Citys financial condition,    Providing information to the Council to facilitate its ability to make informed decisions in  the best interest of the community,    Preparing Council meeting agendas and attending all such meetings to serve as a resource  to the Council and the public, and    Bringing  needs  to  Councils  attention  and  suggesting  or  recommending  solutions  for  problems.   The  City  has  a  number  of  departments,  each  with  a  paid  City  employee  who  manages  the  department. City departments have many roles that use volunteers. The department assigns City  employees to supervise the volunteer activities and the department head is responsible to ensure  that  the  volunteers  understand  their  responsibilities.  Therefore,  department  directors,  with  discussion  with  the  City  Manager,  can  end  any  individual  volunteers  or  volunteer  groups  association with the City that falls under the authority that has been delegated to them by the City  Manager. There are a number of established committees of the City. People serving on them are  themselves volunteers appointed and approved by City Council. Each committee may also have  activities it performs that utilize
