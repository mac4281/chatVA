QUESTION: What area represents Friendswoods greatest economic potential?


PASSAGE: between the types of   4 independent schools  $7 M  tax  exempt  properties,  apartment   2 apartment complexes  $15 M  complexes  and  nursing  homes  being  the   1 nursing home    $2 M  most demanding.     *List does not include all nonprofit property within city limits  The only known way for a city to recoup city  expenses  from  nonprofit  and  tax  exempt  property  is  a  voluntary  program  called  Payment in lieu of taxes PILOT or PILT. This is a program most commonly participated in by the Federal  Government  to  offset  losses  in  property  tax  due  to  non-taxable  federal  land  such  as  military  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Community & Economic Development Committee 8        NEW PAGE  installations, national parks, federal water projects, etc. The government sees this as its way of fulfilling  its role of being a good neighbor to local communities.  Some cities have been successful in having nonprofit organizations voluntarily participate in a PILOT  program; however Friendswood does not have any participants in a program.  In conclusion, PILOT programs are strictly voluntary and cannot be enforced, and there are no other  legal means for a city to recoup expenses associated with tax exempt property. It behooves a city to  negotiate a PILOT program prior to the commencement of a tax exempt development, especially if the  entity is going to be demanding upon vital services.     DOWNZONING  When there are references to downzoning in this report, the term is more specifically defined as  the rezoning of commercially-zoned property to any residential-type use (single-family, multi- family apartments, assisted living facilities and nursing homes) as these residential uses have  tenants which demand essential city services, i.e. fire, EMS, police, library, and parks that most  commercial enterprises do not require.      In 1998, Vision 2020 recommended that the city follow an 80/20 residential-commercial land use  plan.  Vision 2020 also forewarned that as the city builds out and runs out of residential-zoned  land, there will be pressure for city officials to rezone commercial land to residential to meet  market demand.  In addition, as land becomes scarce, the value of land will rise and place  pressure on the city to allow higher density residential development in order to support the  higher land prices.  The committee does not feel that rezoning commercial property along high  traffic, prime commercial corridors, particularly FM 528, FM 2351, and FM 518 coincides with the   Citys long-term goals for developing the tax base or is in the best interest of the city.    As the City builds out and runs out of residential zoned land, there will be pressure    to rezone commercial land to meet market demand.  Vision 2020            At City Councils request, the CEDC discussed and reviewed councils idea to require a fiscal or   economic impact analysis for zone change requests.  The CEDC recommends the following factors  be considered when a downzoning request is received: current zoning, future land use map,  highest and best use, economic/fiscal impact to the property, city services and the tax base, and  how  the  proposed  zone  change  would  positively/negatively  impact  surrounding  properties.   Since there are many factors to consider with downzoning requests, the CEDC recommends that  an economic/fiscal impact analysis be prepared and submitted to the city for all downzonings or  zone  change  requests  from  commercial  to  any  type  of  residential  use,  including  residential  planned unit developments.      In moving forward, the CEDC believes there is no economic benefit for the city to approve  rezoning requests that change the land use from commercial to any type of residential use.  If  City Council determines that a specific type of development would benefit the city, then special  consideration should be


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The greatest economic potential for Friendswood lies in commercial development. This is based on the fact that commercial development generates more tax revenue than residential development and also requires less city services. Therefore, the city should focus on approving rezoning requests that change the land use from commercial to any type of residential use.
