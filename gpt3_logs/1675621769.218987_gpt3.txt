DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The passage suggests that Friendswood's greatest economic potential lies in commercial and retail development, as these generate property, sales, and inventory taxes. Residential developments generate property tax, but with a 20% homestead exemption. Nonprofit organizations and tax-exempt entities generate no tax. The use of prime commercial real estate for tax-exempt development is shortsighted and detrimental to the financial future of any city. Furthermore, tax-exempt development typically deters neighboring property from retail and commercial development as parking, alcohol, and other restrictions make development more problematic.
