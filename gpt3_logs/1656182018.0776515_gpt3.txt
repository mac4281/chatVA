Write a detailed summary of the following:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court looked at the precedent set by the Roe decision itself. The Court noted that Roe was incorrectly decided and that it relied on an erroneous historical narrative. Second, the Court considered the precedent set by the Casey decision, which revised the textual basis for the abortion right and silently abandoned Roes erroneous historical narrative. Finally, the Court looked at the precedent set by the Janus and Ramos decisions, which held that States cannot protect fetal life prior to viability.  The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. One of these was the precedent set by previous decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage. The Court also considered the precedent set by the Three-fifths Compromise, which allowed states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of taxation and representation. Finally, the Court considered the precedent set by the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects certain rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution.  The Supreme Court considered two main historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade. The first was Brown v. Board of Education, which held that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The second was West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, which held that minimum wage laws did not violate the Constitution. The Court also considered the current controversy over abortion, but did not find that it outweighed the other two precedents.  The Supreme Court considered a number of historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v Wade. Firstly, they considered the fact that abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before the Roe decision was handed down. Secondly, they noted that the precedents Roe cited (including Griswold and Eisenstadt) were all critically different because none of them involved the destruction of what Roe called potential life. Without support in history or relevant precedent, the Court found that Roes reasoning could not be defended even under the proposed test of the dissent, and that therefore the precedent of Roe should be overruled.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, taking into consideration several historical precedents. Firstly, they look at the precedent set by Roe itself and find that it was incorrectly decided and relied on an erroneous historical narrative. Secondly, they look at the precedent set by Casey, which revised the textual basis for the abortion right and silently abandoned Roe's erroneous historical narrative. Finally, they look at the precedent set by Janus and Ramos, which held that States cannot protect fetal life prior to viability. All of these factors lead the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.
