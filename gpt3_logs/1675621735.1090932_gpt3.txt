DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The area that represents Friendswood's greatest economic potential is the Panhandle. This area is rich in resources and has the potential to attract businesses in the target industries of professional office, healthcare, retail, commercial, and light industrial. The CEDC will continue to promote the Live Here Work Here program to cultivate business expansions and start-ups in the community and will require a fiscal impact analysis on downzoning property and a formal process for the CEDC to have input to Planning and Zoning and City Council on all commercial rezoning requests.
