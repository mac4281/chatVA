QUESTION: How do I restore entitlement?


PASSAGE: Funding Fee  Entitlement is based on service  Lenders Role,  in the Selected Reserve and/or National Guard so an increased funding  continued  fee is required.    Refinance Restoration  Restored entitlement previously used or  charged for a VA Loan Indetification Number (LIN) as shown here is  available only for use in connection with the property which secured  that loan.   One-Time Restoration  Entitlement previously used for a VA LIN has  been restored without disposal of the property, under provision of 38  U.S.C. 3702 (b)(4).  Any future restoration requires disposal of all  property obtained with a VA loan.   Subsequent Use Funding Fee  Entitlement code of 5 indicates  previously used entitlement has been restored.  The Veteran must pay a  subsequent use funding fee on any future loan unless the Veteran is  exempt.   Surviving Spouse  Eligibility of the surviving spouse and the validity  of guaranty entitlement hereby evidenced will be null and void if any  change in marital status occurs, subsequent to the date of this COE and  prior to the date a loan to the widow or widower is closed, unless the  lender making the loan was not aware of any change in marital status  and obtained on the date the loan closed an affidavit from the surviving  spouse in the form prescribed by the Secretary.   Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA)  This certificate  evidences eligibility under 38 U.S.C 3701 (b)(3) of the individual  named as the spouse of a Servicemember missing in action or prisoner  of war.  Any unused entitlement will terminate automatically upon the  receipt of official notice that the Servicemember is no longer in a  category specified in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(3) or upon dissolution of  marriage.   Paid-in-Full Loan  Entitlement charged on a paid-in-full loan cannot  be restored until the Veteran applies for restoration of entitlement.  The  lender shall submit the application electronically through VAs  Automated Certificate of Eligibility (ACE) online application.    Foreclosed Loan  Entitlement charged on a foreclosed loan cannot be  restored until VAs loss on the loan has been fully repaid.  Information  about repayment of the loss may be obtained by contacting an RLC.

How to Establish the Applicants Eligibility for a VA Loan,    continued     b. The  Although this chapter discusses some of the basic eligibility criteria, it is not  Lenders Role,  intended to provide a lender with all the knowledge necessary to make an  continued  eligibility determination; consequently, all the various exceptions and nuances  of eligibility are not included.  Appendix 1-A at the end of this chapter  provides a quick reference and overview of basic eligibility criteria.    Lenders must use VAs ACE online application to obtain the COE. Go to  VAs Information Portal (VIP) and select WebLGY from the applications  toolbar; then select Eligibility and follow the prompts.  In many cases, a COE  can be generated in seconds.  If not, lenders should select the link to submit an  electronic application.  This method allows lenders to upload supporting  documentation and submit an application electronically to be processed by one  of the RLCs.    A Veteran can apply for a COE through eBenefits at  http://www.ebenefits.va.gov or, if necessary, by completing VA Form 26-  1880, Request for a Certificate of Eligibility and mailing it to the listed RLC.   Simultaneous applications may delay COE processing.To ensure quicker  responses, it is preferable to apply online.       c. IRRRL  VA systems will not generate a VA case number for an Interest Rate  Eligibility  Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL) if there is no record of an active VA  Determination  loan.  This means if a lender successfully obtains a case number for an IRRRL,  a COE is not required.     2-4    NEW PAGE  VA Pamphlet


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

There are three ways to restore entitlement: 1. Refinance Restoration: This is available if you have previously used entitlement for a VA Loan Identification Number (LIN). Entitlement can be restored for use with the same property that secured the original loan. 2. One-Time Restoration: This is available if you have previously used entitlement for a VA LIN, but have not disposed of the property. Any future restoration will require disposal of all property obtained with a VA loan. 3. Subsequent Use Funding Fee: This is available if you have previously used entitlement and it has been restored. You will need to pay a subsequent use funding fee on any future loan, unless you are exempt.
