PASSAGE: (1992). As explained herein, the Court in each case relied on traditional stare decisis factors in overruling. A great many of the overrulings the majority cites involve a prior precedent that had been rendered out of step with or effectively abrogated by contemporary case law in light of intervening developments in the broader doctrine. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 22) (holding the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous jury verdict in state prosecutions for serious offenses, and overruling Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972), because in the years since Apodaca, this Court ha[d] spoken inconsistently about its meaning and had undercut its validity on at least eight occasions); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 608609 (2002) (recognizing a Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find the aggravating factors necessary to impose a death sentence and, in so doing, rejecting Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), as overtaken by and irreconcilable with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000)); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235236 (1997) (considering the Establishment Clauses constraint on government aid to religious instruction, and overruling Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), in light of several related doctrinal developments that had so undermined Aguilar and the assumption on which it rested as to render it no longer good law); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 9396 (1986) (recognizing that a defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of a jury venire by relying solely on the facts in his case, and, based on subsequent developments in equal protection law, rejecting part of Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), which had imposed a more demanding evidentiary  BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting 62 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Appendix to opinion of BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ. burden); Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447448 (1969) (per curiam) (holding that mere advocacy of violence is protected by the First Amendment, unless intended to incite it or produce imminent lawlessness, and rejecting the contrary rule in Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357 (1927), as having been thoroughly discredited by later decisions); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 351, 353 (1967) (recognizing that the Fourth Amendment extends to material and communications that a person seeks to preserve as private, and rejecting the more limited construction articulated in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), because we have since departed from the narrow view on which that decision rested, and the underpinnings of Olmstead . . . have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the trespass doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 463467, 479, n. 48 (1966) (recognizing that the Fifth Amendment requires certain procedural safeguards for custodial interrogation, and rejecting Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958), which had already been undermined by Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964)); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 69 (1964) (explaining that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the States, and rejecting Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), in light of a marked shift in Fifth Amendment precedents that had necessarily repudiated the prior decision); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 343345 (1963) (acknowledging a right to counsel for indigent criminal defendants in state court under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and overruling the earlier precedent failing to recognize such a right, Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 63 Appendix to opinion of BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ. 455 (1942));31
