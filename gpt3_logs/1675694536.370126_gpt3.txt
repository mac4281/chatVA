EncompassAdministrators have several options available for handling Multi-Factor Authentication security in EncompassLOConnect. By default, EncompassLOConnect is set up to utilize PingID as the Multi- Factor Authentication option. This option is something that the Administrator does not need to configure, and the EncompassLOConnect user enables this when they log into EncompassLOConnect. The Admin can choose to disable Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for their EncompassLOConnect instance. This option should only be disabled if your company is using an alternate security method. To use this option in Encompass, view the Enable MFA on Encompass section of the How to Set Up MFA With Your Existing Provider guide located here.
