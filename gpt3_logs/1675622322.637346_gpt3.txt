The CEDC recommends the City launch a public awareness campaign to help communicate the  FM 528 Strategy and the overall importance to diversify the tax base.  A uniform message is  needed that delivers a pro development image to attract commercial developers and brokers to  the  city.    This  can  be  done  via  the  Public,  Educational,  and Governmental  Access channel,  website, and social media.  Special ads and op ed pieces can be written and distributed to the  local  media.    Packets  of  the  final  report  should  be  made  available  to  HOAs,  landowners,  developers, retailers, and local organizations such as the Friendswood Chamber and Rotary.   Board and committees also expressed their desire to stay informed as well as Friendswood  residents.  A video of the Mayor with a pro development message can be produced and accessed  on the Citys website.      PROPERTY OWNERS INPUT  There are currently 71 separate lots that total 1,348 acres of undeveloped commercial property abutting  FM 528 within the city limits of Friendswood, with an assessed value of $22 million.


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The top non-residential taxpayers in Friendswood are land and home owners. While residential growth has been easy, commercial growth has proven more challenging due to competing localities that are more conducive to commercial development, primarily the I-45 retail corridor. With real estate corridors for commercial development limited, city officials have established key commercial zones along prime traffic corridors that would allow the city just enough prime real estate to reach its 80/20 (residential/commercial) goal. In addition, targeted businesses SIC/NAICS codes were identified that best fit in the community.
