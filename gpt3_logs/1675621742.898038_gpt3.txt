QUESTION: What area represents Friendswoods greatest economic potential?


PASSAGE: transportation  projects  will  only  enhance  the  commercial  development  potential  along  the  FM  528  corridor.  The  Brittany Bay Blvd project, in the long- term, should increase the traffic flow  along FM 528 corridor and thereby  entice  prospective  retail  and  commercial developers to the area.   RETAINING EXISTING  DEVELOPMENT  As a business grows and matures, it  provides  possibilities  for  expansion  within  the  community.    There  are  many factors that an existing business  considers when they are considering  to expand within a city, the primary  being the cost and availability of land,  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Community & Economic Development Committee 14        NEW PAGE  building,  utilities  as  well  as  taxes,  business  climate,  and  being  recognized  or  appreciated  in  the  community.  While city services, i.e. safety, are important many other factors can lead a business to stay  or leave.  Due to the citys high occupancy rate of office space, development of new spec office space is  in demand.  The city should continue its Live Here Work Here campaign which has been a great  success.  Having contact with the city staff and officials opens up dialogue and provides the business an  opportunity to share their possible future expansion plans or business needs.  There are many resources  including the Friendswood Chamber of Commerce and Galveston County Small Business Development  Center that can help with networking, loans, marketing plans, and business plan assistance.  THE FUTURE OF FM 528  The FM 528 corridor provides more opportunities for future commercial development, particularly for  retail businesses, than any other place in the city.  Retail businesses preferred location is usually  influenced by high traffic areas, corner sites,  pedestrian foot traffic, neighboring retailers  nearby, and community demographics.  FM  528 is linked to I-45 with great visibility and  physical  attributes  of  being  a  seven-lane  road that carries more than 31,000 cars per  day.    There  are  large  commercial  tracts  available  along  the  corridor.    That  being  said, there is a strong demand for one to  five-acre tracts along FM 528 at FM 518 that  are  not  available.  The  citys  zoning  ordinance  provides  adequate  buffering  between  residential  and  commercial  uses  and the permitted use table defines which  uses  are  appropriate  in  the  citys  various  commercial  zones.    The  majority  of  undeveloped land along FM 528 is either  currently  zoned  commercial  or  is  in  the  Future Land Use Map as commercial use.    At the pace of current development in the  city, residential will build out first in the city  leaving undeveloped commercial land.  City  Council  should  encourage  commercial  development  and  protect  this  prime  real  estate  against  downzoning  to  residential  use.  Since all zone change requests must  come before the Planning and Zoning Commission for their consideration and  FM 528 Traffic Counts  recommendation, and then on to City Council for approval, these decisions on  1985  13,700  rezoning and development proposals can affect the community and its tax  base for many years.    1990  21,000    1995  21,000  In conclusion, the city can either stay focused on diversifying the tax base or  2000  33,000  squander  its  only  opportunity  to  diversify  before build-out  occurs.
