QUESTION: Why did the courts decide to allow states to ban abortion?


PASSAGE: the States lacked the authority to do so. Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described it as the freedom to make “intimate and personal choices” that are “central to personal dignity and autonomy,” 505 U. S., at 851. Ordered     4 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently. The Nation’s historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. Pp. 11–30. (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot be justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s “concept of existence” prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe termed “potential life” and what the law challenged in this case calls an “unborn human being.” None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Accordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and the Court’s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. Pp. 30–32. (b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. It “reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455.

RESPONSE:

The courts decided to allow states to ban abortion because they believed that the states lacked the authority to do so. The supporters of Roe and Casey argued that the abortion right was an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, and Casey described it as the freedom to make “intimate and personal choices” that are “central to personal dignity and autonomy.” The people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently. The Nation’s historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. It “reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455. It “contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris by respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important questions in the past. But stare decisis is not an inexorable command, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.

State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___. Five factors discussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: The nature of the Court’s error: Like the infamous decision in Plessy v Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey perpetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side will feel understandably aggrieved; but more importantly, they will reasonably suspect that their defeat does not turn on the merits of their position—that it is instead a function of politics or raw power… A decision so fraught with consequences for millions of Americans warrants reconsideration… The quality of the Court’s reasoning: The reasoning in Roe is fatally flawed… In Casey…the Court attempted to salvage Roe by resorting to an amorphous notion of liberty… But this reasoning finds no support in precedent or principle… The workability of the decision: Roe has led to a division of authority between state and federal courts on a fundamental issue… This division puts pressure on state courts to follow Roe in order to protect their citizens from federal interference…and it puts pressure on federal courts to construe Roe narrowly in order to avoid preempting state law… This tension has produced inconsistent results and confusion… The reliance interests at stake: The cost of overturning Roe would be minimal… There is no reliable evidence that overturning Roe would lead to widespread bans on abortion… The precision of Roe’s holding: Roe purports to recognize a right to abortion that is broad enough to encompass any reason for terminating a pregnancy… This is not an accurate description of the legal landscape at the time Roe was decided…
