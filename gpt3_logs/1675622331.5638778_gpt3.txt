RESPONSE:

The top non-residential taxpayers in the city are those who have been appointed to committees by the city council, as well as those who have signed a user agreement or letter agreement with the city. These volunteers typically work on projects or events that are important to the community, and they receive no pay or benefits for their time and efforts.
