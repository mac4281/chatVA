QUESTION: Who are the top non-residential taxpayers?


PASSAGE: 6.12 GRATUITIES OR FINANCIAL GAIN  Volunteers  may  not  accept  any  gift  or  gratuity,  no  matter  how  small,  from  any  firm,  contractor, consultant, individual, or others for whom any service is to be or was provided  by the City. If a gratuity is offered, the volunteer should kindly reject the offer and report it  to their supervisor. Occasionally the City may sponsor celebratory events that rejoice in the  efforts of volunteers. These events may include meals or small tokens of appreciation from  the City that volunteers are free to accept.   6.13  COMPUTER USAGE  The City of Friendswoods email and internet systems are intended to be used exclusively  for official purposes. The City of Friendswood owns the computer and software of email and  internet systems and permits their use in the performance of duties, when necessary.   Volunteers, who have computer, email and internet access shall comply with the Citys  email and internet policy. Official City business sent or received by anyone via electronic  15 | P a ge     NEW PAGE  transmission is subject to the Texas Public Information Act and as such is subject to public  disclosure  upon  request.  There  should  be  no  expectation  of  privacy  on  City  provided  computers or electronic devices. Any violation of this policy or use of the Citys computers  for any unauthorized purpose such as downloading music, entertainment, offensive jokes or  cartoons, pornography, internet dating sites, video gaming, unauthorized software, etc. will  result in administrative action or permanent dismissal as a volunteer and could result in  possible Federal or State criminal prosecution(s).  6.14 SOCIAL MEDIA  As Americans, we all enjoy constitutional rights to free speech which includes personal  social media. When posting to personal social media, if a volunteer writes about volunteer  related  activities,  readers  may  perceive  the  individual  to  be  writing  on  behalf  of  or  representing the views of the City. If the volunteer is not acting in an official or authorized  City capacity, the volunteer must use a disclaimer or make it clear that the views expressed  are personal only and not necessarily the views of the City.   Participation in social media, whether by City or non-City internet resources and whether  made while volunteering or not, must not violate the privacy rights of other City volunteers,  employees, customers, or business partners or any City policy or regulation.  When participating in social media, volunteers are expected to know and follow all City  and/or department policies and regulations regarding official information. They are also  expected to be respectful, truthful, accurate and not engage in cyber bullying, retaliatory or  harassing behavior.   While what people express on social media is governed by constitutional rights and other  statutes, the City may consider statements made on private social media as grounds to  restrict a persons volunteer activities or access to official information.   6.15  END OF SERVICE AND RETURN OF CITY PROPERTY  All City property shall be returned at or before the time of separation, including but not  limited to: City uniforms or clothing, ID badges, keys, computers, parking permits, radios,  tools or other equipment. Failure to return these items can be considered theft and may result  in prosecution.  6.16  CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION OF CITY VOLUNTEER EXPECTATIONS  The City recognizes the positive value of its volunteers and hopes that there are not any  cases where these consequences need to be applied.  There  are  volunteer  behaviors  such  as  workplace  violence,  theft,  embezzlement,  and  intoxication, among others, which violate criminal statutes and may result in police action.  The  person  committing  the  offense  may  be  subject  to  penalties.  Furthermore,  some  violations, such as confidentiality violations directed at other volunteers, City employees or  16 | P a ge     NEW PAGE
