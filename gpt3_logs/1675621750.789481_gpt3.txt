This corridor is currently the city's prime commercial real estate, and records show that it generates a substantial portion of Friendswood's property and sales tax.

Therefore, the main goal should be to deter, or minimize, further development along this corridor that does not have the potential for increased city revenue. Additionally, it is recommended that when financial resources become available, preferential consideration be given for infrastructure improvement, beautification, and attracting desired development.
