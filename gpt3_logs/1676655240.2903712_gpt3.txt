DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

There is no one form that is universally accepted as proof of service for veterans. However, the DD214 Form is generally accepted as proof of service. This form contains all the information needed for the VA to determine eligibility for benefits. Veterans who were separated from service after October 1, 1979, should provide Member Copy 2, 4, 8, or any copy of a DD214 Form that includes the COS and the narrative reason for separation. Veterans who were separated from service before January 1, 1950, received documentation other than DD214 Form. To be acceptable, it should indicate: a) LOS, and b) COS.
