challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729730. That applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a    8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus strong presumption of validity. Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319. It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id., at 320.

These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents constitutional challenge must fail. Pp. 76 78.

DOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ET AL. ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court. Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views. Some believe fervently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a womans right to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality. Still others in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under some but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be imposed. For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution, each State was permitted to address this issue in accordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this Court decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113. Even though the Constitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held that it confers a broad right to obtain one. It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever recognized   2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court such a right, and its survey of history ranged from the constitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of abortion in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its assertion that abortion was probably never a crime under the common law). After cataloging a wealth of other information having no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that might be found in a statute enacted by a legislature. Under this scheme, each

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has overturned a lower court ruling that struck down a Mississippi law that would have banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The 5-4 decision, with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the court's three other conservatives in the majority, is a major victory for abortion opponents and a blow to abortion rights advocates. The decision does not immediately impact abortion laws in other states, but it paves the way for more restrictions on abortion to be enacted. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, states that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion. Thomas writes that the Court's previous decisions on the matter, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, were "wrongly decided" and "should be overruled." Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented from the opinion.
