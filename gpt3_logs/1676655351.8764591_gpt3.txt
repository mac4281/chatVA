QUESTION: How do I apply for a COE?


PASSAGE: quick reference and overview of basic eligibility criteria.    Lenders must use VAs ACE online application to obtain the COE. Go to  VAs Information Portal (VIP) and select WebLGY from the applications  toolbar; then select Eligibility and follow the prompts.  In many cases, a COE  can be generated in seconds.  If not, lenders should select the link to submit an  electronic application.  This method allows lenders to upload supporting  documentation and submit an application electronically to be processed by one  of the RLCs.    A Veteran can apply for a COE through eBenefits at  http://www.ebenefits.va.gov or, if necessary, by completing VA Form 26-  1880, Request for a Certificate of Eligibility and mailing it to the listed RLC.   Simultaneous applications may delay COE processing.To ensure quicker  responses, it is preferable to apply online.       c.

For example it may say:                                                              THIS VETERANS BASIC ENTITLEMENT IS $_________ .   TOTAL ENTITLEMENT CHARGED TO PREVIOUS VA  LOANS IS $_______  .    For loans greater than $144,000, bonus entitlement may be available.  For  loans greater than $144,000, but less than $484,350, the entitlement is 25  percent.  For loans greater than $484,350, the maximum entitlement is 25  percent of the loan limit, which can vary by county. For a list of loan limits by  county, visit  http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/lenders.asp.  Please note  county limits can change yearly.  VA will post the limits for each year on our  website as they change.    The Veteran may have entitlement for loans greater than  $144,000, the COE does not reflect the bonus entitlement.  Instead, an asterisk  by the word available refers to a note, which explains the possibility of  additional entitlement.    If the Veteran previously used entitlement, which has not been restored,  available entitlement is reduced by the amount used on the prior loan(s).  The  lender has three options in this situation:      Make the loan knowing that VAs guaranty is limited to the amount of  available entitlement, or    Have the Veteran apply for restoration of previously used entitlement,  or    The Veteran may provide a downpayment in conjunction with their  remaining entitlement.
