From its beginning in 1895, that volunteer spirit has flowed freely through the community. The  schools, the churches, the City, the museums, the library, the fire department, the police department,    sport programs for youth, the July 4th celebrations, animal shelters, etc., are all richer for the gifts of  time and money so generously given by Friendswood citizens for over 120 years.   Joycina Baker - Friendswoods Official Historian.     Volunteers serve in many capacities in the City  and often interact with the public on the Citys  behalf. It can be the first and lasting impression  for a citizen dealing with the City. Volunteer-led  projects have built parks and facilities that last  for many years and serve to make our community  unique.   The  goal of this Guidebook is to enhance the  experience of every volunteer for participation in  our City life and establish a comprehensive tool  to encourage teamwork.  This Friendswood Volunteer Guidebook should  serve as a guide for participation of volunteers, describe the treatment volunteers should expect and  explain what is expected of them.   This Guidebook is considered an evolving document with periodic updates anticipated due


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

There are four steps to authenticate a user in Encompass: 1. In the Invite to Apply window, select your Email Template and Encompass Consumer Connect Workflow from their drop-down fields, and click the Send button. 2. The Invite and Remind links included in your message are system-generated and will display in your recipient's email inbox. These links are valid for 24 hours only. 3. If your lead does not take action on the Invite link within 24 hours, the link expires at their end, and the Invite To Apply menu option in LO Connect continues to display as Invite To Apply. 4. If the borrower takes action within the 24 hours, creates an ECC borrower profile, but does not submit the application, the Invite To Apply menu option in LO Connect updates to Remind To Apply.
