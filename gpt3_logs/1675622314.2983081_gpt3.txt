PASSAGE: not to exceed ten years of city  property taxes on the increment in value added to a particular property by a specific development  proposal, which meets the economic goals and objectives of the city. The tax abatement shall not apply  to any portion of the inventory or land value of the project. Tax abatement may be offered on  improvements to real property owned by the applicant and/or on new personal property brought to the  site by the applicant.   Freeport Tax Exemption  The City of Friendswood can exempt personal property consisting of goods,  wares, merchandise or ores other than oil, natural gas, and petroleum.  Under Tax Code, Section 11.251,  eligible property must be transported out of the state within 175 days of acquisition, but must first be  assembled, stored, manufactured, processed, or fabricated locally.  Other Funding Mechanisms  Neighborhood Empowerment Zone  Chapter 378 of the Local Government Code allows cities to create  a zone within their municipal boundaries to promote/increase economic development within the zone,  affordable housing, and social services, education, or public safety of the zone.  A municipality may  create more than one zone and may include an area in more than one zone.  A municipality may grant  one or more of the following within the zone:  waive or adopt fees related to the construction of  buildings in the zone, including fees related to inspection of the building and impact fees; enter into  agreements, for a period of not more than 10 years, for the purpose of benefiting the zone, for refunds  of municipal sales tax on sales made in the zone; enter into tax abatement agreements subject to the  duration and limits under Chapter 312, and set baseline performance standards, such as Energy Star  Program as developed by the Department of Energy, to encourage the use of alternative building  materials that address concerns relating to the environment or to the building costs, maintenance, or  energy consumption.  Type B Economic Development Sales Tax  A city is eligible to adopt a Type B sales tax, with voter  approval, if the new combined local sales tax rate would not exceed 2%.  361 cities in Texas have passed  the Type B tax.

Downtown  improvements  including burying overhead power lines and pedestrian improvements are also eligible uses.  Hotel Occupancy Tax  Under Chapter 351 of the Tax Code, a city may adopt a hotel occupancy tax rate  of up to 7%.  The state of Texas imposes a 6% rate that applies throughout the state.  The hotel tax  revenues must be used locally to pay for tourism-related promotion of a city including improvements or  maintenance  of  convention/civic  center  facilities,  administrative  costs  for  convention  registration,  programs that enhance the arts, historical restoration or preservation, costs to hold sporting events, and  signage to attractions, funding transportation systems for tourists.   In conclusion, if funding for capital improvement projects that will encourage business development is  not available, the city should consider other funding mechanisms that have been successfully used in  many cities, counties, and states such as developer reimbursements, sales tax refunds, special financing
