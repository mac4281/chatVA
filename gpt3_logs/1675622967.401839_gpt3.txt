RESPONSE:

The goal of the economic development policy is to diversify the tax base through business attraction, retention, and expansion. The policy also aims to support and spearhead efforts to develop infrastructure to ensure that adequate sites are available for target business development. Additionally, the policy seeks to position Friendswood as a place for new and expanded business development and investment within the target industries of professional office, retail, commercial, and light industrial in concert with zoning and the permitted use table.
