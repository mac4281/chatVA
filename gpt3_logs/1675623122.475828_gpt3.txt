PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

Step 3 in the economic development strategic plan is to market and position Friendswood as a place for new and expanded business development and investment within the target industries of professional office, retail, commercial, and light industrial in concert with zoning and the permitted use table.  The third step in the economic development strategic plan is to rezone commercial property to residential. The city cannot keep chipping away at the remaining commercially zoned real estate, especially the prime FM 528 commercial real estate, and expect to meet future financial demands without raising property tax rates. Commercial developments generate significantly more tax revenue and consume a fraction of the city services. Now is the time to adopt this strategy and implement it across all facets of the city.  The 3rd step in the economic development strategic plan is to proactively rezone properties that are designated as future commercial use in the Future Land Use Map.
