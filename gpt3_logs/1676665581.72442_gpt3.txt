RESPONSE:

A VA loan is a loan for eligible veterans to purchase or construct a residence, including a condominium unit to be owned and occupied by the veteran as a home. The loan may include simultaneous purchase of the land on which the residence is situated or will be situated, loans may also be guaranteed for the construction of a residence on land already owned by the veteran (a portion of the loan may be used to refinance a purchase money mortgage or sales contract for the purchase of the land, subject to reasonable value requirements), and the residential property may not consist of more than four family units and one business unit except in the case of certain joint loans.
