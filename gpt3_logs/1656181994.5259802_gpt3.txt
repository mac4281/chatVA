QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: https://www.healthaffairs. org/do/10.1377/forefront.20220503.129912/.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 37 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting fere with the mailing of drugs used for medication abortions? The Constitution protects travel and speech and interstate commerce, so todays ruling will give rise to a host of new constitutional questions. Far from removing the Court from the abortion issue, the majority puts the Court at the center of the coming interjurisdictional abortion wars. Id., at ___ (draft, at 1). In short, the majority does not save judges from unwieldy tests or extricate them from the sphere of controversy. To the contrary, it discards a known, workable, and predictable standard in favor of something novel and probably far more complicated. It forces the Court to wade further into hotly contested issues, including moral and philosophical ones, that the majority criticizes Roe and Casey for addressing. B When overruling constitutional precedent, the Court has almost always pointed to major legal or factual changes undermining a decisions original basis. A review of the Appendix to this dissent proves the point. See infra, at 6166. Most successful proponent[s] of overruling precedent, this Court once said, have carried the heavy burden of persuading the Court that changes in society or in the law dictate that the values served by stare decisis yield in favor of a greater objective. Vasquez, 474 U. S., at 266. Certainly, that was so of the main examples the majority cites: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937). But it is not so today. Although nodding to some arguments others have made about modern developments, the majority does not really rely on them, no doubt seeing their slimness. Ante, at 33; see ante, at 34. The majority briefly invokes the current controversy over abortion. See ante, at 7071. But it has to acknowledge that the same dispute has existed for   38 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting decades: Conflict over abortion is not a change but a constant. (And as we will later discuss, the presence of that continuing division provides more of a reason to stick with, than to jettison, existing precedent. See infra, at 5557.) In the end, the majority throws longstanding precedent to the winds without showing that anything significant has changed to justify its radical reshaping of the law. See ante, at 43. 1 Subsequent legal developments have only reinforced Roe and Casey. The Court has continued to embrace all the decisions Roe and Casey cited, decisions which recognize a constitutional right for an individual to make her own choices about intimate relationships, the family, and contraception. Casey, 505 U. S., at 857. Roe and Casey have themselves formed the legal foundation for subsequent decisions protecting these profoundly personal choices. As discussed earlier, the Court relied on Casey to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects same-sex intimate relationships. See Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 578; supra, at 23. The Court later invoked the same set of precedents to accord constitutional recognition to same-sex marriage. See Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 665666; supra, at 23. In sum, Roe and Casey are inextricably interwoven with decades of precedent about the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. See supra, at 2124. While the majority might wish it otherwise, Roe and Casey are the very opposite of obsolete constitutional thinking. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 236 (1997) (quoting Casey, 505 U. S., at 857). Moreover, no subsequent factual developments have undermined Roe and Casey. Women continue to experience unplanned pregnancies and unexpected developments in pregnancies. Pregnancies continue to have enormous physical, social, and economic consequences. Even an uncompli-  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 39 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ.,


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered two main historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade. The first was Brown v. Board of Education, which held that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The second was West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, which held that minimum wage laws did not violate the Constitution. The Court also considered the current controversy over abortion, but did not find that it outweighed the other two precedents.
