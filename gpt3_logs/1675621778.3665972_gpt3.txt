QUESTION: What area represents Friendswoods greatest economic potential?


PASSAGE: districts, grants, and incentives.  Most CIP infrastructure projects that benefit economic development  are large and are planned, prioritized and implemented on a proactive basis in cities, however funding is  typically limited since there are many competing needs and demands throughout the city.  Special  financing districts, grants, and incentives are typically considered when a development proposal is  presented.  The CEDC recommends that City Council seek CEDCs input and recommendation on the use  of special financing districts, grants, and incentives for any commercial project development proposal or  incentive application.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

Friendswood's greatest economic potential lies in improving infrastructure on south FM 528. The city has a plan for the required infrastructure but does not have a schedule or funding strategy. TXDOT and the City of Friendswood will continue to expand and improve the transportation infrastructure, which will include a portion of the proposed circumferential highway and Brittany Bay Boulevard. These two large projects will improve access to south FM 528 and make it more attractive to commercial developers.
