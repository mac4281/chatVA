QUESTION: CAn lenders use reduced documentation when using AUD?


PASSAGE: from the date transfer of the property may not  be necessary.    If the foreclosure, deed and lieu or short sale was on a VA-guaranteed loan,  then a borrower may not have full entitlement available for the new VA loan.   Ensure that the borrowers COE reflects sufficient entitlement to meet any  secondary marketing requirements of the lender.    4-55     NEW PAGE  VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised   Chapter 4: Credit Underwriting    8. Automated Underwriting Cases (AUS)      Change Date  February 22, 2019       This chapter has been revised in its entirety.            VA has approved Freddie Macs Loan Prospector, Fannie Maes Desktop  a. General AUS  Underwriter, and VA approved proprietary lender AUS systems to use in  Information  connection with VA-guaranteed home loans.  These systems incorporate VAs  credit standards and processing requirements.    Lenders may use certain reduced documentation requirements on cases  processed with approved AUS.  The level of reduced documentation depends  on the risk classification assigned.  The systems use different terminology such  as Approve or Accept.  The tables in this section give a general description of  documentation waivers.  Please note that the documentation requirements are  the same for these cases as for non-AUS cases, except for any differences cited  in the tables.    The automated systems do not approve or disapprove loans.  They merely  determine a risk classification.  It is still the lenders underwriters decision  whether or not to approve the loan.      Although VA has approved the use of these systems, we are not the vendor.   The terms and conditions of use must be negotiated directly with the provider  of these systems.    It is imperative that the data entered into the automated underwriting system  be accurately verified.  The data utilized by the system must be supported by  source documentation obtained by the lender.  Inaccurate or unverified data  will result in invalidation of the risk classification.  Under certain  circumstances, it could also result in a finding of material misrepresentation,  which could affect the validity of the guaranty.      b.  Because the AUS will be making the determination that the loan satisfies  Underwriters  credit and income requirements, cases receiving an Accept or Approve  Certification  rating will not require the underwriters signature on VA Form 26-6393, Loan  Analysis (items 49 through 53).  However, the file must still contain the  Lenders Certification referenced in Chapter 5 of the VA Lenders Handbook.
