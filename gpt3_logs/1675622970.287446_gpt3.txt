RESPONSE:

The goal of the economic development policy is to improve infrastructure and promote business development in the city. The policy includes actions to research and recommend infrastructure improvements, to monitor capital improvement projects, to consider special financing districts and tax increment financing tools, to reach out to residents and businesses, and to showcase the city to potential investors. The policy also includes a goal to fund and support the "economic development toolbox" which provides incentives and resources for businesses.
