RESPONSE:

It is possible to determine if a borrower is a satisfactory credit risk after bankruptcy if the borrower has obtained consumer items on credit subsequent to the bankruptcy and has satisfactorily made the payments over a continued period. If the bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the borrower or spouse, such as unemployment or medical bills, and these circumstances are verified, this will also be taken into account. However, if the bankruptcy was discharged within the past 12 months, it will generally not be possible to determine that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk.
