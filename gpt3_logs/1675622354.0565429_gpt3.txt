The top non-residential taxpayers in Friendswood are stores that have been converted from residential to commercial use. These include clothing and clothing accessory stores, sporting goods stores, hobby stores, bookstores, and music stores. Retail studies have shown that there is an unmet demand for these types of stores in Friendswood, and that they can provide a significant source of revenue for the city. However, subprime developments that do not produce revenue at their highest and best use can deter future commercial growth and inhibit the diversification of the city's tax base.  The top non-residential taxpayers are independent schools, apartment complexes, and nursing homes. These entities are the most demanding on city services, and the only known way for a city to recoup expenses from them is through a voluntary Payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) program. However, most cities have had success in negotiating PILOT programs with nonprofit organizations, and Friendswood does not currently have any participants in such a program.  The top non-residential taxpayers in Friendswood are commercial and retail developments, which generate property, sales, and inventory tax. Residential developments generate property tax, less 20% homestead exemption. Nonprofit organizations and tax exempt entities like the city, county, state, and federal government generate no tax.

The asking price for these properties ranges from $.80 to $25 per square foot, with the closer to the intersection of FM 528 and FM 518, the higher the asking price. The types of prospective buyers and end users that have expressed the most interest in purchasing these properties are residential, retirement communities, and religious assemblies. The property owners unanimously agree with the strategy, but have given numerous opinions about why they believe the strategy will not be adhered to, including that the city has a reputation of residential neighborhoods fighting commercial development, that City Council caves in to residential neighbors who object to commercial development, and that the city has negative stigma as not being developer friendly.
