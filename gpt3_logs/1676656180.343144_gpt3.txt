RESPONSE:

According to the passage, an attorney's opinion is encouraged in order to expedite VA approval of a condominium project. The opinion must be prepared in letter form on the attorney's firm's letterhead and must be signed, dated, and show the name and title of the attorney rendering the opinion. The opinion must address four areas: project identification, documents reviewed, attorney's qualifications, and attorney's opinion.
